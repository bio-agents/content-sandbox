      "sc:description": "A database for exploring N6-methyladenosine methylome.\n\nREPIC (RNA Epitranscriptome Collection) is a database dedicated to provide a new resource to investigate potential functions and mechanisms of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) modifications. Currently, The database includes about 700 samples of 50 public studies that were reprocessed by our refined pipeline. The database also contains ENCODE histone ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data to correlate m6A modifications. It provided multi-dimensional information (e.g. cell or tissue specificity) to query m6A modification relevance in cellular processes. In addition, a built-in modern genome browser presented a comprehensive atlas of m6A modifications which is helpful to visualize m6A modification sites between different samples and conditions.",

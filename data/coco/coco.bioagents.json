Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Next-generation sequencing techniques revolutionized the study of RNA expression by permitting whole transcriptome analysis. However, sequencing reads generated from nested and multi-copy genes are often either misassigned or discarded, which greatly reduces both quantification accuracy and gene coverage. Results: Here we present count corrector (CoCo), a read assignment pipeline that takes into account the multitude of overlapping and repetitive genes in the transcriptome of higher eukaryotes. CoCo uses a modified annotation file that highlights nested genes and proportionally distributes multimapped reads between repeated sequences. CoCo salvages over 15% of discarded aligned RNA-seq reads and significantly changes the abundance estimates for both coding and non-coding RNA as validated by PCR and bedgraph comparisons. Availability and implementation: The CoCo software is an open source package written in Python and available from http://gitlabscottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/scott-group/coco. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

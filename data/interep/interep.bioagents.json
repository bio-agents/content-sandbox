                "abstract": "© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We introduce interep, an R package for interaction analysis of repeated measurement data with high-dimensional main and interaction effects. In G × E interaction studies, the forms of environmental factors play a critical role in determining how structured sparsity should be imposed in the high-dimensional scenario to identify important effects. Zhou et al. (2019) (PMID: 31816972) proposed a longitudinal penalization method to select main and interaction effects corresponding to the individual and group structure, respectively, which requires a mixture of individual and group level penalties. The R package interep implements generalized estimating equation (GEE)-based penalization methods with this sparsity assumption. Moreover, alternative methods have also been implemented in the package. These alternative methods merely select effects on an individual level and ignore the group-level interaction structure. In this software article, we first introduce the statistical methodology corresponding to the penalized GEE methods implemented in the package. Next, we present the usage of the core and supporting functions, which is followed by a simulation example with R codes and annotations. The R package interep is available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

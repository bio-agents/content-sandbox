The standardized BioBrick parts are the foundation of synthetic biology. The incomplete and flawed metadata of BioBrick parts, however, are a major obstacle for designing genetic circuit easily, quickly, and accurately. Here, a database termed BioMaster http://www.biomaster-uestc.cn was developed to extensively complement information about BioBrick parts, which includes 47,934 items of BioBrick parts from the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Registry with more comprehensive information integrated from 10 databases, providing corresponding information about functions, activities, interactions, and related literature. Moreover, BioMaster is also a user-friendly platform for retrieval and analyses of relevant information on BioBrick parts.",

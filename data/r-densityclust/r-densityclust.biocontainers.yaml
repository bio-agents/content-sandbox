description: An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the density
  peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro
  Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344). It can handle large datasets (> 100, 000 samples)
  very efficiently. It was initially implemented by Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs
  from Sean Hughes and later improved by Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets with
  kNNs.

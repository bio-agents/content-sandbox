description: '''FASTQC'' is the most widely used agent for evaluating the quality of
  high throughput sequencing data. It produces, for each sample, an html report and
  a compressed file containing the raw data. If you have hundreds of samples, you
  are not going to open up each ''HTML'' page. You need some way of looking at these
  data in aggregate. ''fastqcr'' Provides helper functions to easily parse, aggregate
  and analyze ''FastQC'' reports for large numbers of samples. It provides a convenient
  solution for building a ''Multi-QC'' report, as well as, a ''one-sample'' report
  with result interpretations.'

      "sc:description": "Codaloss: direct interaction network inference for compositional data. One essential step in the analysis of microbiome compositional data is inferring the direct interaction network among microbial species. Here, we propose a novel loss function called codaloss for direct microbes interaction network estimation under the sparsity assumptions. We develop an alternating direction optimization algorithm to obtain sparse solution of codaloss as estimator. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our model makes less assumptions about the microbial networks and outperforms them in network inference.",

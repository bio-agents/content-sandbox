      "sc:description": "Autonomous Agent for Measuring Intracellular Dynamics using Temporal Variance.\n\nTrafficking of intracellular cargo is essential to cellular function and can be defective in pathological states including cancer and neurodegeneration. Agents to quantify intracellular traffic are thus necessary for understanding this fundamental cellular process, studying disease mechanisms, and testing the effects of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. IQuoVadoPro that autonomously quantifies the movement of fluorescently tagged intracellular cargo. QuoVadoPro infers the extent of intracellular motility based on the variance of pixel illumination in a series of time-lapse images. The algorithm is an unconventional approach to the automatic measurement of intracellular traffic and is suitable for quantifying movements of intracellular cargo under diverse experimental paradigms.",

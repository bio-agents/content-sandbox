    "description": "Mol* Viewer is web app for 3D visualization and analysis of large biomolecular structures. Large biomolecular structures are being determined experimentally on a daily basis using established techniques such as crystallography and electron microscopy. In addition, emerging integrative or hybrid methods (I HM) are producing structural models of huge macromolecular machines and assemblies, sometimes containing 100s of millions of non-hydrogen atoms. The performance requirements for visualization and analysis agents delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization agents was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB)",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Large biomolecular structures are being determined experimentally on a daily basis using established techniques such as crystallography and electron microscopy.

Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization agents was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol∗ development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol∗ Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol∗ Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.",

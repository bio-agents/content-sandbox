                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Most complex disease-associated loci mapped by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are located in non-coding regions. It remains elusive which genes the associated loci regulate and in which tissues/cell types the regulation occurs. Here, we present PCGA (https://pmglab.top/pcga), a comprehensive web server for jointly estimating both associated tissues/cell types and susceptibility genes for complex phenotypes by GWAS summary statistics. The web server is built on our published method, DESE, which represents an effective method to mutually estimate driver tissues and genes by integrating GWAS summary statistics and transcriptome data. By collecting and processing extensive bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, PCGA has included expression profiles of 54 human tissues, 2,214 human cell types and 4,384 mouse cell types, which provide the basis for estimating associated tissues/cell types and genes for complex phenotypes. We develop a framework to sequentially estimate associated tissues and cell types of a complex phenotype according to their hierarchical relationships we curated. Meanwhile, we construct a phenotype-cell-gene association landscape by estimating the associated tissues/cell types and genes of 1,871 public GWASs. The association landscape is generally consistent with biological knowledge and can be searched and browsed at the PCGA website.",

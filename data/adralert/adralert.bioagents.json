Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.Drug safety is a severe clinical pharmacology and toxicology problem that has caused immense medical and social burdens every year. Regretfully, a reproducible method to assess drug safety systematically and quantitatively is still missing. In this study, we developed an advanced machine learning model for de novo drug safety assessment by solving the multilayer drug-gene-adverse drug reaction (ADR) interaction network. For the first time, the drug safety was assessed in a broad landscape of 1,156 distinct ADRs. We also designed a parameter ToxicityScore to quantify the overall drug safety. Moreover, we determined association strength for every 3,807,631 gene-ADR interactions, which clues mechanistic exploration of ADRs. For convenience, we deployed the model as a web service ADRAlert-gene at http://www.bio-add.org/ADRAlert/. In summary, this study offers insights into prioritizing safe drug therapy. It helps reduce the attrition rate of new drug discovery by providing a reliable ADR profile in the early preclinical stage.",

Recently, with the rapid increase of both clinical and non-clinical data, machine learning methods have emerged as prominent agents to support analyzing and predicting ADRs. Nonetheless, there are still remaining challenges in ADR studies. Results: In this paper, we summarized ADR data sources and review ADR studies in three tasks: Drug-ADR benchmark data creation, drug-ADR prediction and ADR mechanism analysis. We focused on machine learning methods used in each task and then compare performances of the methods on the drug-ADR prediction task. Finally, we discussed open problems for further ADR studies.

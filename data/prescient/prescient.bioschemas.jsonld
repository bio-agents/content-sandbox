      "sc:description": "PRESCIENT (Potential eneRgy undeRlying Single-Cell gradIENTs) is a agent for simulating cellular differentiation trajectories with arbitrary cell state intializations. PRESCIENT frames differentiation as a diffusion process given by a stochastic ODE with a drift parameter given by a generative neural network. PRESCIENT models can simulate cellular differentiation trajectories for out-of-sample (i.e. not seen during training) cells, enabling robust fate prediction and perturbational analysis. Here, we package PRESCIENT as a command-line agent and PyPI package.",

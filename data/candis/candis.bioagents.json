Their fusion with other biological data enables insights into disease mechanisms and novel opportunities for drug discovery. Results: We developed Causal Network of Diseases (CaNDis), a web server for the exploration of a human causal interaction network, which we expanded with data on diseases and FDA-approved drugs, on the basis of which we constructed a disease-disease network in which the links represent the similarity between diseases. We show how CaNDis can be used to identify candidate genes with known and novel roles in disease co-occurrence and drug-drug interactions.",

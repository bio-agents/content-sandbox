Identifying the distributions of 6mA modifications in genome-scale is of great significance to in-depth understand the functions. In recent years, various experimental and computational methods have been proposed for this purpose. Unfortunately, existing methods cannot provide accurate and fast 6mA prediction. In this study, we present 6mAPred-FO, a bioinformatics agent that enables researchers to make predictions based on sequences only. To sufficiently capture the characteristics of 6mA sites, we integrate the sequence-order information with nucleotide positional specificity information for feature encoding, and further improve the feature representation capacity by analysis of variance-based feature optimization protocol. The experimental results show that using this feature protocol, we can significantly improve the predictive performance. Via further feature analysis, we found that the sequence-order information and positional specificity information are complementary to each other, contributing to the performance improvement. On the other hand, the improvement is also due to the use of the feature optimization protocol, which is capable of effectively capturing the most informative features from the original feature space. Moreover, benchmarking comparison results demonstrate that our 6mAPred-FO outperforms several existing predictors. Finally, we establish a web-server that implements the proposed method for convenience of researchers' use, which is currently available at http://server.malab.cn/6mAPred-FO.",

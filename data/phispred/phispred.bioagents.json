                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Protein histidine phosphorylation (pHis) plays critical roles in prokaryotic signal transduction pathways and various eukaryotic cellular processes. It is estimated to account for 6–10% of the phosphoproteome, however only hundreds of pHis sites have been discovered to date. Due to the inherent disadvantages of experimental methods, it is an urgent task for developing efficient computational approaches to identify pHis sites. Results: Here, we present a novel agent, pHisPred, for accurately identifying pHis sites from protein sequences. We manually collected the largest number of experimental validated pHis sites to build benchmark datasets. Using randomized tenfold CV, the weighted SVM-RBF model shows the best performance than other four commonly used classification models (LR, KNN, RF, and MLP). From ten thousands of features, 140 and 150 most informative features were individually selected out for eukaryotic and prokaryotic models. The average AUC and F1-score values of pHisPred were (0.81, 0.40) and (0.78, 0.46) for tenfold CV on the eukaryotic and prokaryotic training datasets, respectively. In addition, pHisPred significantly outperforms other agents on testing datasets, in particular on the eukaryotic one. Conclusion: We implemented a python program of pHisPred, which is freely available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/xiaofengsong/pHisPred. Moreover, users can use it to train new models with their own data.",

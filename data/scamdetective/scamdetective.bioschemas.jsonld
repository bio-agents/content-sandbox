SCAM Detective models were developed to predict, with high accuracy, the detergent-sensitive aggregation of compounds in AmpC Î²-lactamase and cruzain inhibition assays, the preferred counter-screens used widely to identify false positives in the HTS campaigns.\n\nThe SCAM Detective provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.\n\nThe SCAM Detective application provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.",

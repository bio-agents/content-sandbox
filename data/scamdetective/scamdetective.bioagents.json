    "description": "Accurate Predictor of Small, Colloidally Aggregating Molecules.\n\nSCAM Detective is a machine learning application and web portal (https://scamdetective.mml.unc.edu/) to identify putative Small Colloidally Aggregating Molecules (SCAMs) in chemical libraries used in high-throughput screening (HTS). SCAM Detective models were developed to predict, with high accuracy, the detergent-sensitive aggregation of compounds in AmpC β-lactamase and cruzain inhibition assays, the preferred counter-screens used widely to identify false positives in the HTS campaigns.\n\nThe SCAM Detective provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.\n\nThe SCAM Detective application provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 American Chemical Society.Small, colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs) are the most common source of false positives in high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns. Although SCAMs can be experimentally detected and suppressed by the addition of detergent in the assay buffer, detergent sensitivity is not routinely monitored in HTS. Computational methods are thus needed to flag potential SCAMs during HTS triage. In this study, we have developed and rigorously validated quantitative structure-interference relationship (QSIR) models of detergent-sensitive aggregation in several HTS campaigns under various assay conditions and screening concentrations. In particular, we have modeled detergent-sensitive aggregation in an AmpC β-lactamase assay, the preferred HTS counter-screen for aggregation, as well as in another assay that measures cruzain inhibition. Our models increase the accuracy of aggregation prediction by ∼53% in the β-lactamase assay and by ∼46% in the cruzain assay compared to previously published methods. We also discuss the importance of both assay conditions and screening concentrations in the development of QSIR models for various interference mechanisms besides aggregation. The models developed in this study are publicly available for fast prediction within the SCAM detective web application (https://scamdetective.mml.unc.edu/).",

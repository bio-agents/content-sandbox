                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s)There is a critical need to understand the health risks associated with vaping e-cigarettes, which has reached epidemic levels among teens. Juul is currently the most popular type of e-cigarette on the market. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org), a public resource that integrates chemical, gene, phenotype and disease data, we aimed to analyze the potential molecular mechanisms of eight chemicals detected in the aerosols generated by heating Juul e-cigarette pods: nicotine, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, free radicals, crotonaldehyde, acetone, pyruvaldehyde, and particulate matter. Curated content in CTD, including chemical-gene, chemical-phenotype, and chemical-disease interactions, as well as associated phenotypes and pathway enrichment, were analyzed to help identify potential molecular mechanisms and diseases associated with vaping. Nicotine shows the most direct disease associations of these chemicals, followed by particulate matter and formaldehyde. Together, these chemicals show a direct marker or mechanistic relationship with 400 unique diseases in CTD, particularly in the categories of cardiovascular diseases, nervous system diseases, respiratory tract diseases, cancers, and mental disorders. We chose three respiratory tract diseases to investigate further, and found that in addition to cellular processes of apoptosis and cell proliferation, prioritized phenotypes underlying Juul-associated respiratory tract disease outcomes include response to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and several cell signaling pathways (p38MAPK, NIK/NFkappaB, calcium-mediated).",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The public Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) is an innovative digital ecosystem that relates toxicological information for chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and exposures to advance understanding about human health. Literature-based, manually curated interactions are integrated to create a knowledgebase that harmonizes cross-species heterogeneous data for chemical exposures and their biological repercussions. In this biennial update, we report a 20% increase in CTD curated content and now provide 45 million toxicogenomic relationships for over 16 300 chemicals, 51 300 genes, 5500 phenotypes, 7200 diseases and 163 000 exposure events, from 600 comparative species. Furthermore, we increase the functionality of chemical-phenotype content with new data-tabs on CTD Disease pages (to help fill in knowledge gaps for environmental health) and new phenotype search parameters (for Batch Query and Venn analysis agents). As well, we introduce new CTD Anatomy pages that allow users to uniquely explore and analyze chemical-phenotype interactions from an anatomical perspective. Finally, we have enhanced CTD Chemical pages with new literature-based chemical synonyms (to improve querying) and added 1600 amino acid-based compounds (to increase chemical landscape). Together, these updates continue to augment CTD as a powerful resource for generating testable hypotheses about the etiologies and molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.",

                "abstract": "The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the interaction of environmental chemicals with gene products, and their effects on human health. Biocurators at CTD manually curate a triad of chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease relationships from the literature. These core data are then integrated to construct chemical-gene-disease networks and to predict many novel relationships using different types of associated data. Since 2009, we dramatically increased the content of CTD to 1.4 million chemical-gene-disease data points and added many features, statistical analyses and analytical agents, including GeneComps and ChemComps (to find comparable genes and chemicals that share toxicogenomic profiles), enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with chemicals, statistically ranked chemical-disease inferences, Venn diagram agents to discover overlapping and unique attributes of any set of chemicals, genes or disease, and enhanced gene pathway data content, among other features. Together, this wealth of expanded chemical-gene-disease data continues to help users generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of environmental diseases.

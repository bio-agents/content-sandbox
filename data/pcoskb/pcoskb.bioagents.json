This data has been retrieved based on evidence gleaned by critically reviewing literature and related records available for PCOS in databases such as KEGG, DisGeNET, OMIM, GO, Reactome, STRING, and dbSNP. Since PCOS is associated with multiple genes and comorbidities, data mining algorithms for comorbidity prediction and identification of enriched pathways and hub genes are integrated in PCOSKBR2, making it an ideal research platform for PCOS. PCOSKBR2 is freely accessible at http://www.pcoskb.bicnirrh.res.in/.",

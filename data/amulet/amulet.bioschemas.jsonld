      "sc:description": "AMULET: ATAC-seq MULtiplet Estimation Agent which is a novel read count-based method for effective multiplet detection from single nucleus ATAC-seq data.\n\nRunning AMULET consists of two parts: 1) Identifying all loci with >2 uniquely aligning reads for each cell, and 2) detecting multiplets that have more loci with >2 reads than expected. The bash shell script combines both of these steps, but they can be run independently as well. The latter (multiplet detection) may be useful for running multiplet detection using q-values different from the default.",

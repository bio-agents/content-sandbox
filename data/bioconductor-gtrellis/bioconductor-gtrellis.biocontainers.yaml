description: Visualize genomic data conditioned by genomic categories (e.g. chromosomes).
  for each genomic category, multiple dimensional data which are represented as tracks
  describe different features from different aspects. this package provides high flexibility
  to arrange genomic categories and to add self-defined graphics in the plot.

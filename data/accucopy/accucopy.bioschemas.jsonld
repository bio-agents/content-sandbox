      "sc:description": "Accucopy is a CNA-calling method that extends our previous Accurity model to predict both total (TCN) and allele-specific copy numbers (ASCN) for the tumor genome. Accucopy adopts a tiered Gaussian mixture model coupled with an innovative autocorrelation-guided EM algorithm to find the optimal solution quickly. The Accucopy model utilizes information from both total sequencing coverage and allelic sequencing coverage.",

      "sc:description": "Fast prediction of bacteriophage Virion proteins using un-biased multi-perspective properties with recursive feature elimination | Bacteriophage virion proteins (BVPs) are bacterial viruses that have a great impact on different biological functions of bacteria. They are significantly used in genetic engineering and phage therapy applications. Correct identification of BVP through conventional pathogen methods are slow and expensive. Thus, designing a Bioinformatics predictor is urgently desirable to accelerate correct identification of BVPs within a huge volume of proteins. However, available prediction agents performance is inadequate due to the lack of useful feature representation and severe imbalance issue. In the present study, we propose an intelligent model, called Pred-BVP-Unb for discrimination of BVPs that employed three nominal sequences-driven descriptors, i.e",

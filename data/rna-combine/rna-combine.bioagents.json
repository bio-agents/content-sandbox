                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Understanding the transcriptome has become an essential step towards the full interpretation of the biological function of a cell, a tissue or even an organ. Many agents are available for either processing, analysing transcriptome data, or visualizing analysis results. However, most existing agents are limited to data from a single sequencing platform and only several of them could handle more than one analysis module, which are far from enough to meet the requirements of users, especially those without advanced programming skills. Hence, we still lack an open-source agentkit that enables both bioinformatician and non-bioinformatician users to process and analyze the large transcriptome data from different sequencing platforms and visualize the results. Results: We present a Linux-based agentkit, RNA-combine, to automatically perform the quality assessment, downstream analysis of the transcriptome data generated from different sequencing platforms, including bulk RNA-seq (Illumina platform), single cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics) and Iso-Seq (PacBio) and visualization of the results. Besides, this agentkit is implemented with at least 10 analysis modules more than other agentkits examined in this study. Source codes of RNA-combine are available on GitHub: https://github.com/dongxuemin666/RNA-combine. Conclusion: Our results suggest that RNA-combine is a reliable agent for transcriptome data processing and result interpretation for both bioinformaticians and non-bioinformaticians.",

      "sc:description": "Prediction of Allosteric Sites Server.\n\nTo approach this problem, PASSer is designed for accurate allosteric sites prediction. Ensemble learning, consisting of eXtreme gradient boosting and graph convolutional neural network, is used to learn the physical properties and topology information.\n\nAllostery is the process by which proteins transmit perturbations caused by the binding effect at one site to another distal site. Allosteric process is fundamental in regulation of activity. The identification of allosteric sites is important for allosteric drug development and has attracted a wide range of interests.",

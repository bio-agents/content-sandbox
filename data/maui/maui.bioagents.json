MIBI_GUI is a set of three graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for low-level analysis of MIBI data. The three steps of low-level analysis (after you've extracted your data) are background removal, denoising, and aggregate removal.",

Imaging artifacts, resulting from the sample, assay or instrumentation complicate downstream analyses and require correction by domain experts. Here, we present MBI Analysis User Interface (MAUI), a series of graphical user interfaces that facilitate this data pre-processing, including the removal of channel crosstalk, noise and antibody aggregates. Our software streamlines these steps and accelerates processing by enabling real-time and interactive parameter tuning across multiple images.",

description: ChExMix aims to characterize protein-DNA binding subtypes in ChIP-exo
  experiments. ChExMix assumes that different regulatory complexes will result in
  different protein-DNA crosslinking signatures in ChIP-exo data, and thus analysis
  of ChIP-exo sequencing tag patterns should enable detection of multiple protein-DNA
  binding modes for a given regulatory protein. ChExMix uses a mixture modeling framework
  to probabilistically model the genomic locations and subtype membership of protein-DNA
  binding events, leveraging both ChIP-exo tag enrichment patterns and DNA sequence
  information. In doing so, ChExMix offers a more principled and robust approach to
  characterizing binding subtypes than simply clustering binding events using motif
  information.

Early and effective diagnosis of glioma using diagnostic biomarkers can prolong patients’ lives and aid in the development of new personalized treatments. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic biomarkers in gliomas is of great significance. To this end, we developed the integrated and web-based database GlioMarker (http://gliomarker.prophetdb.org/), the first comprehensive database for knowledge exploration of glioma diagnostic biomarkers. In GlioMarker, accurate information on 406 glioma diagnostic biomarkers from 1559 publications was manually extracted, including biomarker descriptions, clinical information, associated literature, experimental records, associated diseases, statistical indicators, etc. Importantly, we integrated many external resources to provide clinicians and researchers with the capability to further explore knowledge on these diagnostic biomarkers based on three aspects. (1) Obtain more ontology annotations of the biomarker. (2) Identify the relationship between any two or more components of diseases, drugs, genes, and variants to explore the knowledge related to precision medicine. (3) Explore the clinical application value of a specific diagnostic biomarker through online analysis of genomic and expression data from glioma cohort studies. GlioMarker provides a powerful, practical, and user-friendly web-based agent that may serve as a specialized platform for clinicians and researchers by providing rapid and comprehensive knowledge of glioma diagnostic biomarkers to subsequently facilitates high-quality research and applications.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2016 Mendoza-Parra et al.Background: Proximity ligation-mediated methods are essential to study the impact of three-dimensional chromatin organization on gene programming. Albeit significant progress has been made in the development of computational agents that assess long-range chromatin interactions, next to nothing is known about the quality of the generated datasets. Method: We have developed LOGIQA ( www.ngs-qc.org/logiqa ), a database hosting quality scores for long-range genome interaction assays, accessible through a user-friendly web-based environment. Results: Currently, LOGIQA harbors QC scores for >900 datasets, which provides a global view of their relative quality and reveals the impact of genome size, coverage and other technical aspects. LOGIQA provides a user-friendly dataset query panel and a genome viewer to assess local genome-interaction maps at different resolution and quality-assessment conditions. Conclusions: LOGIQA is the first database hosting quality scores dedicated to long-range chromatin interaction assays, which in addition provides a platform for visualizing genome interactions made available by the scientific community.",

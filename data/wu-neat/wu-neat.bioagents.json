    "description": "Neonatal EEG Analysis Agentbox (NEAT). A clinically validated, open-source MATLAB agentbox for limited-channel neonatal EEG analysis.\n\nMany qualitative and quantitative metrics have been developed to analyze the output of limited-channel EEG recordings in neonates. A significant roadblock in the widespread dissemination of these techniques is the device-specific, “black-box” nature of the analytic algorithms, preventing comparison between studies and the obsolescence of old recordings as software is abandoned. We have developed NEAT (Neonatal EEG Analysis Agentbox) as an open-source software platform to overcome these challenges. NEAT runs within MATLAB and is designed to work with any single-channel EEG input, regardless of source or sampling rate. The second release adds support for GNU Octave.",

                "abstract": "© 2020Background: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open, accessible analytic agents. To overcome this limitation, we have created the Washington University-Neonatal EEG Analysis Agentbox (WU-NEAT), containing two of the most commonly used agents, provided in an open-source, clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification. Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean±SD Pearson correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96±0.04. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a clinically-validated agentbox for generating the aEEG as well as calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and unlikely to become outdated as technology changes, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal EEG.",

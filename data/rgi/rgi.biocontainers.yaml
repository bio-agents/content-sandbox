description: This agent provides a preliminary annotation of your dna sequence(s) based
  upon the data available in the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (card).
  hits to genes tagged with antibiotic resistance ontology terms will be highlighted.
  as card expands to include more pathogens, genomes, plasmids, and ontology terms
  this agent will grow increasingly powerful in providing first-pass detection of antibiotic
  resistance associated genes. see license at card website

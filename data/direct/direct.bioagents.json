                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Background: It is widely believed that tertiary nucleotide-nucleotide interactions are essential in determining RNA structure and function. Currently, direct coupling analysis (DCA) infers nucleotide contacts in a sequence from its homologous sequence alignment across different species. DCA and similar approaches that use sequence information alone typically yield a low accuracy, especially when the available homologous sequences are limited. Therefore, new methods for RNA structural contact inference are desirable because even a single correctly predicted tertiary contact can potentially make the difference between a correct and incorrectly predicted structure. Here we present a new method DIRECT (Direct Information REweighted by Contact Templates) that incorporates a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to augment the information on sequence co-variations with structural features in contact inference. Results: Benchmark tests demonstrate that DIRECT achieves better overall performance than DCA approaches. Compared to mfDCA and plmDCA, DIRECT produces a substantial increase of 41 and 18%, respectively, in accuracy on average for contact prediction. DIRECT improves predictions for long-range contacts and captures more tertiary structural features. Conclusions: We developed a hybrid approach that incorporates a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to augment the information on sequence co-variations with structural templates in contact inference. Our results demonstrate that DIRECT is able to improve the RNA contact prediction.",

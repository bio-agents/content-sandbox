Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Pseudotime analysis from scRNA-seq data enables to characterize the continuous progression of various biological processes, such as the cell cycle. Cell cycle plays an important role in cell fate decisions and differentiation and is often regarded as a confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis when analyzing the role of other factors. Therefore, accurate prediction of cell cycle pseudotime and identification of cell cycle stages are important steps for characterizing the development-related biological processes. Here, we develop CCPE, a novel cell cycle pseudotime estimation method to characterize cell cycle timing and identify cell cycle phases from scRNA-seq data. CCPE uses a discriminative helix to characterize the circular process of the cell cycle and estimates each cell's pseudotime along the cell cycle. We evaluated the performance of CCPE based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Our results indicate that CCPE is an effective method for cell cycle estimation and competitive in various applications compared with other existing methods. CCPE successfully identified cell cycle marker genes and is robust to dropout events in scRNA-seq data. Accurate prediction of the cell cycle using CCPE can also effectively facilitate the removal of cell cycle effects across cell types or conditions.",

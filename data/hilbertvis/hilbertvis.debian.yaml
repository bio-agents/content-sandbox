description: This agent allows one to display very long data vectors in a space-efficient
  manner, by organising it along a 2D Hilbert curve. The user can then visually judge
  the large scale structure and distribution of features simultaenously with the rough
  shape and intensity of individual features. . In bioinformatics, a typical use case
  is ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq, or basically all the kinds of genomic data, that are
  conventionally displayed as quantitative track ("wiggle data") in genome browsers
  such as those provided by Ensembl or UCSC.

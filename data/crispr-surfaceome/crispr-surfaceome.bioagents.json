                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The AuthorsCRISPR-based genome-editing agents have emerged as an efficient agent for functional genomics studies. Online agents and databases have been developed to facilitate the design and selection of CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) for gene modifications. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these agents or database are designated to cell surface proteins. In a previous study, we described the development and application of surfaceome CRISPR libraries targeting to cell surface proteins on human cells. Here, we present the design and construction of an online agent and database (https://crispr-surfaceome.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/home), named CRISPR-Surfaceome, for the design of highly efficient sgRNA targeting to the surface proteins on human cells. To show case and validate the efficiencies of sgRNAs designed by this online agent, we chose ICAM-1 gene for knockout studies and found that all the 10 designed ICAM-1 sgRNAs could efficiently generate knockout cells, with more than 80% gene disruption rates. These ICAM-1 knockout cells were found to be resistant to the infection of rhinovirus (RV), which utilizes ICAM-1 as the receptor. Therefore, CRISPR-Surfaceome can serve the research community for the functional genomics studies on cell surface proteins, such as identification of pathogen receptors and discovery of drug targets.",

description: Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational expensive
  function calls.  The first time a function that implements memoization is called
  the results are stored in a cache memory.  The next time the function is called
  with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the
  cache avoiding repeating the calculations.  With this package, any R object can
  be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R objects.  The
  cache memory is persistent (on the file system).

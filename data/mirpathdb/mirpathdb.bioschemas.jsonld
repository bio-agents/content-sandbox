      "sc:description": "A novel release of the miRNA Pathway Dictionary Database.\n\nSince the initial release of miRPathDB, tremendous progress has been made in the field of microRNA (miRNA) research. New miRNA reference databases have emerged, a vast amount of new miRNA candidates has been discovered and the number of experimentally validated target genes has increased considerably. Hence, the demand for a major upgrade of miRPathDB, including extended analysis functionality and intuitive visualizations of query results has emerged. Here, we present the novel release 2.0 of the miRNA Pathway Dictionary Database (miRPathDB) that is freely accessible at https: mpd.bioinf.uni-sb.de. miRPathDB 2.0 comes with a ten-fold increase of pre-processed data.",

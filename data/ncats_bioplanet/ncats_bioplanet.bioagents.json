Chemical activity profiling approaches must consider chemical effects on all pathways operative in mammalian cells. To enable a strategic and maximally efficient chemical profiling of pathway space, we have created the NCATS BioPlanet, a comprehensive integrated pathway resource that incorporates the universe of 1,658 human pathways sourced from publicly available, manually curated sources, which have been subjected to thorough redundancy and consistency cross-evaluation. BioPlanet supports interactive browsing, retrieval, and analysis of pathways, exploration of pathway connections, and pathway search by gene targets, category, and availability of corresponding bioactivity assay, as well as visualization of pathways on a 3-dimensional globe, in which the distance between any two pathways is proportional to their degree of gene component overlap. Using this resource, we propose a strategy to identify a minimal set of 362 biological assays that can interrogate the universe of human pathways. The NCATS BioPlanet is a public resource, which will be continually expanded and updated, for systems biology, toxicology, and chemical genomics, available at http://tripod.nih.gov/bioplanet/.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: The biggest hurdle in studying topology in biopolymers is the steep learning curve for actually seeing the knots in structure visualization. Knot_pull is a command line utility designed to simplify this process - it presents the user with a smoothing trajectory for provided structures (any number and length of protein, RNA or chromatin chains in PDB, CIF or XYZ format), and calculates the knot type (including presence of any links, and slipknots when a subchain is specified).",

description: 'Cells of the immune system are the grand exception to the rule that
  all cells of an individuum have (mostly exact) copies of the same DNA. B cells (which
  produce antibodies) and T cells (which communicate with cells) however have a section
  of their DNA with genes of the groups V, D and J that are reorganised within the
  genomic DNA to provide the flexibility to deal with yet unknown pathogens. . This
  package provides a platform for the advanced analysis of T cell receptor repertoire
  data and its visualisations. . Caveat: This package is soon to be replaced by http://github.com/immunomind/immunarch
  which is not yet available as a Debian package.'

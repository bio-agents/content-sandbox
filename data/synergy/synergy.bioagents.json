For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: Combinations of multiple pharmacological agents can achieve a substantial benefit over treatment with single agents alone. Combinations that achieve 'more than the sum of their parts' are called synergistic. There have been many proposed frameworks to understand and quantify drug combination synergy with different assumptions and domains of applicability. We introduce here synergy, a Python library that (i) implements a broad array of popular synergy models, (ii) provides agents for evaluating confidence intervals and conducting power analysis and (iii) provides standardized agents to analyze and visualize drug combinations and their synergies and antagonisms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: synergy is available on all operating systems for Python >=3.5. It is freely available from https://pypi.org/project/synergy, and its source code is available at https://github.com/djwooten/synergy.

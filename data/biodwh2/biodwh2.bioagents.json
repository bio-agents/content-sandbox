    "description": "As research projects require multiple data sources, mapping between these sources becomes necessary. Utilized workflow systems and integration agents therefore need to process large amounts of heterogeneous data formats, check for data source updates, and find suitable mapping methods to cross-reference entities from different databases. BioDWH2 is an open-source, graph-based data warehouse and mapping agent, capable of helping researchers with these issues. A workspace centered approach allows project-specific data source selections and Neo4j or GraphQL server agents enable quick access to the database for analysis. The BioDWH2 agents are available to the scientific community at https://github.com/BioDWH2.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: One challenging aspect of genotyping and association mapping projects is often the identification of markers that are informative between groups of individuals and to convert these into genotyping assays. Results: The Multiple SNP Query Agent (MSQT) extracts SNP information from multiple sequence alignments, stores it in a database, provides a web interface to query the database and outputs SNP information in a format directly applicable for SNP-assay design. MSQT was applied to Arabidopsis thaliana sequence data to develop SNP genotyping assays that distinguish a recurrent parent (Col-0) from five other strains. SNPs with intermediate allele frequencies were also identified and developed into markers suitable for efficient genetic mapping among random pairs of wild strains. Â© The Author 2007.

As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. Methods: SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results: In total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established. Conclusions: As a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC.",

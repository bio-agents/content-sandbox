                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s)Interactive visualization is an effective way to promote the reproducibility of results presented in biomedical publications and to facilitate additional exploration of the reported data. However, there is a lack of convenient agents that balance reproducibility with ease of use. To address this problem, we develop BioVisReport, a lightweight solution for the rapid generation of an interactive website based on a user-defined Markdown file, which acts as a text markup language without requiring users to master complex syntax and allows them to preview the results in real-time. Interactive websites generated by the agent can help readers conveniently reproduce research findings and perform further in-depth analyses beyond those reported in the original peer-reviewed publications. Currently, BioVisReport offers 17 basic types of plots for visualizing published data. In addition, the extensibility of BioVisReport supports flexible integration of user-developed Python plugins with multiple programming languages. BioVisReport is freely available at https://biovis.report/.",

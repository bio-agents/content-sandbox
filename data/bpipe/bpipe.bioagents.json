                "abstract": "Bpipe is a simple, dedicated programming language for defining and executing bioinformatics pipelines. It specializes in enabling users to turn existing pipelines based on shell scripts or command line agents into highly flexible, adaptable and maintainable workflows with a minimum of effort. Bpipe ensures that pipelines execute in a controlled and repeatable fashion and keeps audit trails and logs to ensure that experimental results are reproducible. Requiring only Java as a dependency, Bpipe is fully self-contained and cross-platform, making it very easy to adopt and deploy into existing environments. © The Author 2012.

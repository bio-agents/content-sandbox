      "sc:description": "Weighted quality evaluation of assembled microbial genomes | SUMMARY:Metagenomics and single-cell genomics have revolutionized the study of microorganisms, increasing our knowledge of microbial genomic diversity by orders of magnitude. A major issue pertaining to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) is to estimate their completeness and redundancy. Most approaches rely on counting conserved gene markers. In miComplete, we introduce a weighting strategy, where we normalize the presence absence of markers by their median distance to the next marker in a set of complete reference genomes. This approach alleviates biases introduced by the presence absence of shorter DNA pieces containing many markers, e.g. ribosomal protein operons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:miComplete is written in Python 3 and released under GPLv3",

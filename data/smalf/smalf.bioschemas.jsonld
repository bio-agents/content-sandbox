      "sc:description": "SMALF is a miRNA-disease associations prediction agent based on stacked autoencoder and XGBoost. Identifying miRNA and disease associations helps us understand disease mechanisms of action from the molecular level. However, it is usually blind, time-consuming, and small-scale based on biological experiments. Hence, developing computational methods to predict unknown miRNA and disease associations is becoming increasingly important.",

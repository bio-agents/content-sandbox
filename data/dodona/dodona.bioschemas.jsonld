It wants to teach students how to program in the most meaningful and effective way possible, by using different techniques to apply the advantages of personalized coaching in contexts where students usually only have access to traditional coaching (e.g. lectures or exercise sessions) or even no coaching at all (e.g. independent learning or homework).",

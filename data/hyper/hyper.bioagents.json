Existing agents fall short in providing the flexibility to tackle the varied challenges researchers face in such analyses, particularly when analyzing many signatures across multiple experiments. We present a comprehensive R package for geneset enrichment workflows that offers multiple enrichment, visualization, and sharing methods in addition to novel features such as hierarchical geneset analysis and built-in markdown reporting. hypeR is a one-stop solution to performing geneset enrichment for a wide audience and range of use cases.",

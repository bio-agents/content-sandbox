      "sc:description": "A Web Server for Breast Cancer Prognostic Biomarker Investigation With Massive Data From Tens of Cohorts.\n\nPotential prognostic mRNA biomarkers are exploited to assist in the clinical management and treatment of breast cancer, which is the first life-threatening tumor in women worldwide. However, it is technically challenging for untrained researchers to process high dimensional profiling data to screen and validate the potential prognostic values of genes of interests in multiple cohorts. Our aim is to develop an easy-to-use web server to facilitate the screening, developing, and evaluating of prognostic biomarkers in breast cancers",

There are three major types of microenvironmental factors: microbiota-derived metabolites (MDM), microbiota-derived components (MDC) and microbiota-secreted proteins (MSP). These factors can regulate host physiology by modifying host gene expression through the three highly interconnected epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. histone modifications, DNA modifications, and non-coding RNAs). However, no database was available to provide the comprehensive factors of these types. Herein, a database entitled 'Human Microbiome Affect The Host Epigenome (MIAOME)' was constructed. Based on the types of epigenetic modifications confirmed in the literature review, the MIAOME database captures 1068 (63 genus, 281 species, 707 strains, etc.) human microbes, 91 unique microbiota-derived metabolites & components (16 fatty acids, 10 bile acids, 10 phenolic compounds, 10 vitamins, 9 tryptophan metabolites, etc.) derived from 967 microbes; 50 microbes that secreted 40 proteins; 98 microbes that directly influence the host epigenetic modification, and provides 3 classifications of the epigenome, including (1) 4 types of DNA modifications, (2) 20 histone modifications and (3) 490 ncRNAs regulations, involved in 160 human diseases. All in all, MIAOME has compiled the information on the microenvironmental factors influence host epigenome through the scientific literature and biochemical databases, and allows the collective considerations among the different types of factors.

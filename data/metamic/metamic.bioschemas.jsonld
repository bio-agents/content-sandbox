      "sc:description": "metaMIC is a fully automated agent for identifying and correcting misassemblies of (meta)genomic assemblies with the following three steps. Firstly, metaMIC extracts various types of features from the alignment between paired-end sequencing reads and the assembled contigs. Secondly, the features extracted in the first step will be used as input of a random forest classifier for identifying misassembled metagenomic assemblies. Thirdly, metaMIC will localize misassembly breakpoints for each misassembled contig and then correct misassemblies by splitting into parts at the breakpoints.",

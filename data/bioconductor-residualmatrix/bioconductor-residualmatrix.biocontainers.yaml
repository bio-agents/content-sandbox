description: Provides delayed computation of a matrix of residuals after fitting a
  linear model to each column of an input matrix. Also supports partial computation
  of residuals where selected factors are to be preserved in the output matrix. Implements
  a number of efficient methods for operating on the delayed matrix of residuals,
  most notably matrix multiplication and calculation of row/column sums or means.

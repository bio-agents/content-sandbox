description: MetFrag is a freely available software for the annotation of high precision
  tandem mass spectra of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the identification
  of a molecules structure. Candidate molecules of different databases are fragmented
  in silico and matched against mass to charge values. A score calculated using the
  fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment.

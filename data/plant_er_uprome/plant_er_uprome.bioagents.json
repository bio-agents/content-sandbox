                "abstract": "© 2022 The Authors. Plant Direct published by American Society of Plant Biologists and the Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) houses sensors that respond to environmental stress and underly plants' adaptative responses. These sensors transduce signals that lead to changes in nuclear gene expression. The ER to nuclear signaling pathways are primarily attributed to the unfolded protein response (UPR) and are also integrated with a wide range of development, hormone, immune, and stress signaling pathways. Understanding the role of the UPR in signaling network mechanisms that associate with particular phenotypes is crucially important. While UPR-associated genes are the subject of ongoing investigations in a few model plant systems, most remain poorly annotated, hindering the identification of candidates across plant species. This open-source curated database provides a centralized resource of peer reviewed knowledge of ER to nuclear signaling pathways for the plant community. We provide a UPRome interactive viewer for users to navigate through the pathways and to access annotated information. The plant ER UPRome website is located at http://uprome.tamu.edu. We welcome contributions from the researchers studying the ER UPR to incorporate additional genes into the database through the “contact us” page.",

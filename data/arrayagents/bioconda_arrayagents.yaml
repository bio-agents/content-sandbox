description: This package is designed to provide solutions for quality assessment
  and to detect differentially expressed genes for the Affymetrix GeneChips, including
  both 3' -arrays and gene 1.0-ST arrays. The package generates comprehensive analysis
  reports in HTML format. Hyperlinks on the report page will lead to a series of QC
  plots, processed data, and differentially expressed gene lists. Differentially expressed
  genes are reported in tabular format with annotations hyperlinked to online biological
  databases.

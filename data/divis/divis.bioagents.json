                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2021 He, Zhang, Yuan, Han, He, Duan, Liu, Wang and Niu.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has drastically enhanced human cancer research, but diverse sequencing strategies, complicated open-source software, and the identification of massive numbers of mutations have limited the clinical application of NGS. Here, we first presented GPyFlow, a lightweight agent that flexibly customizes, executes, and shares workflows. We then introduced DIVIS, a customizable pipeline based on GPyFlow that integrates read preprocessing, alignment, variant detection, and annotation of whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and gene-panel sequencing. By default, DIVIS screens variants from multiple callers and generates a standard variant-detection format list containing caller evidence for each sample, which is compatible with advanced analyses. Lastly, DIVIS generates a statistical report, including command lines, parameters, quality-control indicators, and mutation summary. DIVIS substantially facilitates complex cancer genome sequencing analyses by means of a single powerful and easy-to-use command. The DIVIS code is freely available at https://github.com/niu-lab/DIVIS, and the docker image can be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sunshinerain/divis.",

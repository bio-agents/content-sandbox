The algorithm scans the generation of each reported PAM for a given DNA sequence and its variations. A successful result is such that at least one PAM is generated by a SNP. Thus, the PAM shall be part of the variant allele only and the Cas protein will therefore be able to exclusively bind the variant allele for gene-editing, while the wildtype allele remains unchanged.",

The technology produces signal spectra that contain information about the chemical dissociation pattern of a peptide that was forced to fragment using methods like collision-induced dissociation. The ability to predict these MS2 signals and to understand this fragmentation process is important for sensitive high-throughput proteomics research. Results: We present a new agent called MS2PIP for predicting the intensity of the most important fragment ion signal peaks from a peptide sequence. MS2PIP pre-processes a large dataset with confident peptide-to-spectrum matches to facilitate data-driven model induction using a random forest regression learning algorithm. The intensity predictions of MS2PIP were evaluated on several independent evaluation sets and found to correlate significantly better with the observed fragment-ion intensities as compared with the current state-of-the-art PeptideART agent.",

The server integrates the Unimod public domain post-translational modification database for modified peptides. The prediction model is an improvement of the previously published MS2PIP model for Orbitrap-LTQ CID spectra. Predicted MS2 spectra can be downloaded as a spectrum file and can be visualized in the browser for comparisons with observations. In addition, we added prediction models for HCD fragmentation (Q-Exactive Orbitrap) and show that these models compute accurate intensity predictions on par with CID performance. We also show that training prediction models for CID and HCD separately improves the accuracy for each fragmentation method. The MS2PIP prediction server is accessible from http://iomics.ugent.be/ms2pip.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.MS²PIP is a data-driven agent that accurately predicts peak intensities for a given peptide's fragmentation mass spectrum. Since the release of the MS²PIP web server in 2015, we have brought significant updates to both the agent and the web server. In addition to the original models for CID and HCD fragmentation, we have added specialized models for the TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer, for TMT-labeled peptides, for iTRAQ-labeled peptides, and for iTRAQ-labeled phosphopeptides. Because the fragmentation pattern is heavily altered in each of these cases, these additional models greatly improve the prediction accuracy for their corresponding data types. We have also substantially reduced the computational resources required to run MS²PIP, and have completely rebuilt the web server, which now allows predictions of up to 100 000 peptide sequences in a single request. The MS²PIP web server is freely available at https://iomics.ugent.be/ms2pip/.",

description: A coalescent simulator that allows the rapid simulation of biological
  sequences under neutral models of evolution. Different to other coalescent based
  simulations, it has an optional approximation parameter that allows for high accuracy
  while maintaining a linear run time cost for long sequences. It is optimized for
  simulating massive data sets as produced by Next- Generation Sequencing technologies
  for up to several thousand sequences.

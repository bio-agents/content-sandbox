The majority of mammalian gut microbiota consists of bacteria. Among various model animals, the mouse has been most widely used in pre-clinical biological experiments. The significant compositional differences in taxonomic profiles among different mouse strains due to gastrointestinal locations, genotypes and vendors have been well documented. However, details of such variations are yet to be elucidated. This study compiled and analyzed 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiles of 554 healthy mouse samples from 14 different projects to construct a comprehensive database of the microbiome of a healthy mouse gastrointestinal tract. The database, named Murine Microbiome Database, should provide researchers with useful taxonomic information and better biological insight about how each taxon, such as genus and species, is associated with locations in the gastrointestinal tract, genotypes and vendors. The database is freely accessible over the Internet.",

  description: agentkit for processing B and T cell sequences
  long_description: " pRESTO is a agentkit for processing raw reads from high-throughput\n\
    \ sequencing of B cell and T cell repertoires.\n .\n Dramatic improvements in\
    \ high-throughput sequencing technologies now\n enable large-scale characterization\
    \ of lymphocyte repertoires, defined\n as the collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor\
    \ proteins located on\n the surface of B cells and T cells. The REpertoire Sequencing\
    \ TOolkit\n (pRESTO) is composed of a suite of utilities to handle all stages\n\
    \ of sequence processing prior to germline segment assignment. pRESTO\n is designed\
    \ to handle either single reads or paired-end reads. It\n includes features for\
    \ quality control, primer masking, annotation of\n reads with sequence embedded\
    \ barcodes, generation of unique molecular\n identifier (UMI) consensus sequences,\
    \ assembly of paired-end reads and\n identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous\
    \ options for sequence\n sorting, sampling and conversion operations are also\
    \ included.\n"

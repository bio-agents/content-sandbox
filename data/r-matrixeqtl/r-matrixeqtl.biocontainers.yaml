description: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets. Matrix
  eQTL can test for association between genotype and gene expression using linear
  regression with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include
  covariates to account for factors as population stratification, gender, and clinical
  variables. It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors,
  false discovery rate estimation and separate treatment of local (cis) and distant
  (trans) eQTLs.

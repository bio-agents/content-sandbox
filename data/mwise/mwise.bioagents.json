                "abstract": "© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) allows the detection of thousands of metabolites in biological samples. However, LC-MS data annotation is still considered a major bottleneck in the metabolomics pipeline since only a small fraction of the metabolites present in the sample can be annotated with the required confidence level. Here, we introduce mWISE (metabolomics wise inference of speck entities), an R package for context-based annotation of LC-MS data. The algorithm consists of three main steps aimed at (i) matching mass-to-charge ratio values to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, (ii) clustering and filtering the potential KEGG candidates, and (iii) building a final prioritized list using diffusion in graphs. The algorithm performance is evaluated with three publicly available studies using both positive and negative ionization modes. We have also compared mWISE to other available annotation algorithms in terms of their performance and computation time. In particular, we explored four different configurations for mWISE, and all four of them outperform xMSannotator (a state-of-the-art annotator) in terms of both performance and computation time. Using a diffusion configuration that combines the biological network obtained from the FELLA R package and raw scores, mWISE shows a sensitivity mean (standard deviation) across data sets of 0.63 (0.07), while xMSannotator achieves a sensitivity of 0.55 (0.19). We have also shown that the chemical structures of the compounds proposed by mWISE are closer to the original compounds than those proposed by xMSannotator. Finally, we explore the diffusion prioritization separately, showing its key role in the annotation process. mWISE is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/b2slab/mWISE) under a GPL license.",

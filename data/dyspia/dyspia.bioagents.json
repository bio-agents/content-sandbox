In most current methods, the pathways were considered as gene sets, but the gene regulation relationships were not considered, and the computational speed was slow. In this article, we proposed a novel Dysregulated Pathway Identification Analysis (DysPIA) method to overcome these shortcomings. We adopted the idea of Correlation by Individual Level Product into analysis and performed a fast enrichment analysis. We constructed a combined gene-pair background which was much more sufficient than the background used in Edge Set Enrichment Analysis. In simulation study, DysPIA was able to identify the causal pathways with high AUC (0.9584 to 0.9896). In p53 mutation data, DysPIA obtained better performance than other methods. It obtained more potential dysregulated pathways that could be literature verified, and it ran much faster (∼1,700–8,000 times faster than other methods when 10,000 permutations). DysPIA was also applied to breast cancer relapse dataset and breast cancer subtype dataset. The results show that DysPIA is effective and has a great biological significance. R packages “DysPIA” and “DysPIAData” are constructed and freely available on R CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DysPIA/index.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DysPIAData/index.html), and on GitHub (https://github.com/lemonwang2020).",

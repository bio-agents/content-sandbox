description: A efficient method to construct bwt index of a given dna sequence, especially\nuseful
  for gigantic and high similar genome. debwt has good scalability to construct bwt
  in parallel computing. it is well-suited to run on multiple core servers or clusters
  to\nconstruct the bwt of large collections of genome sequences.

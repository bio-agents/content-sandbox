                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics.Nanopore sequencing, also known as single-molecule real-time sequencing, is a third/fourth generation sequencing technology that enables deciphering single DNA/RNA molecules without the polymerase chain reaction. Although nanopore sequencing has made significant progress in scientific research and clinical practice, its application has been limited compared with next-generation sequencing (NGS) due to specific design principle and data characteristics, especially in hotspot mutation detection. Therefore, we developed Nano2NGS-Muta as a data analysis framework for hotspot mutation detection based on long reads from nanopore sequencing. Nano2NGS-Muta is characterized by applying nanopore sequencing data to NGS-liked data analysis pipelines. Long reads can be converted into short reads and then processed through existing NGS analysis pipelines in combination with statistical methods for hotspot mutation detection. Nano2NGS-Muta not only effectively avoids false positive/negative results caused by non-random errors and unexpected insertions-deletions (indels) of nanopore sequencing data, improves the detection accuracy of hotspot mutations compared to conventional nanopore sequencing data analysis algorithms but also breaks the barriers of data analysis methods between short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing. We hope Nano2NGS-Muta can serves as a reference method for nanopore sequencing data and promotes higher application scope of nanopore sequencing technology in scientific research and clinical practice.",

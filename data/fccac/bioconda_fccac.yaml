description: 'An application of functional canonical correlation analysis to assess
  covariance of nucleic acid sequencing datasets such as chromatin immunoprecipitation
  followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). The package can be used as well with other
  types of sequencing data such as neMeRIP-seq (see PMID: 29489750).'

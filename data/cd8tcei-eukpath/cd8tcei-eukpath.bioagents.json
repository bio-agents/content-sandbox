As an important class of organisms causing infectious diseases, pathogenic eukaryotes (such as parasitic protozoans) have evolved the ability to colonize a wide range of hosts, including humans and animals; meanwhile, protective vaccines are urgently needed. Inspired by the immunological idea that pathogen-derived epitopes are able to mediate the CD8+ T-cell-related host adaptive immune response and with the available positive and negative CD8+ T-cell epitopes (TCEs), we proposed a novel predictor called CD8TCEI-EukPath to detect CD8+ TCEs of eukaryotic pathogens. Our method integrated multiple amino acid sequence-based hybrid features, employed a well-established feature selection technique, and eventually built an efficient machine learning classifier to differentiate CD8+ TCEs from non-CD8+ TCEs. Based on the feature selection results, 520 optimal hybrid features were used for modeling by utilizing the LightGBM algorithm. CD8TCEI-EukPath achieved impressive performance, with an accuracy of 79.255% in ten-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 78.169% in the independent test. Collectively, CD8TCEI-EukPath will contribute to rapidly screening epitope-based vaccine candidates, particularly from large peptide-coding datasets. To conduct the prediction of CD8+ TCEs conveniently, an online web server is freely accessible (http://lab.malab.cn/∼hrs/CD8TCEI-EukPath/).",

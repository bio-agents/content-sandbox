                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The blood–brain barrier poses major hurdles in the treatment of brain-related ailments. Over the past decade, interest in peptides-based therapeutics has thrived a lot because of their higher benefit to risk ratio. However, a complete knowledgebase providing a well-annotated picture of the peptide as a therapeutic molecule to cure brain-related ailments is lacking. We have built up a knowledgebase B3Pdb on blood–brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating peptides in the present study. The B3Pdb holds clinically relevant experimental information on 1225 BBB-penetrating peptides, including mode of delivery, animal model, in vitro/in vivo experiments, chemical modifications, length. Hoping that drug delivery systems can improve central nervous system disorder-related therapeutics. In this regard, B3Pdb is an important resource to support the rational design of therapeutics peptides for CNS-related disorders. The complete ready-to-use and updated database with a user-friendly web interface is available to the scientific community at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/b3pdb/.",

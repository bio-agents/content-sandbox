For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.The low capture rate of expressed RNAs from single-cell sequencing technology is one of the major obstacles to downstream functional genomics analyses. Recently, a number of imputation methods have emerged for single-cell transcriptome data, however, recovering missing values in very sparse expression matrices remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a new algorithm, WEDGE (WEighted Decomposition of Gene Expression), to impute gene expression matrices by using a biased low-rank matrix decomposition method. WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with sparse datasets. Overall, this study shows a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The source code of WEDGE has been released at https://github.com/QuKunLab/WEDGE.",

description: Smoothing algorithms allow to reduce artifacts from mesh generation,
  but often degrade accuracy. The method described in the paper "Context-aware mesh
  smoothing for biomedical applications" identifies staircase artifacts which result
  from image inhomogeneities and binary segmentation in medical image data for subsequent
  removal by adaptive mesh smoothing. Thus, context-aware smoothing enables to adaptively
  smooth artifact areas, while non-artifact features can be preserved. This is a implementation
  of this method in Cpp with Python bindings.

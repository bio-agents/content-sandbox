                "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Superenhancers are crucial structural genomic elements determining cell fate, and they are also involved in the determination of several diseases, such as cancer or neurodegeneration. Although there are pipelines which use independent pieces of software to predict the presence of superenhancers from genome-wide chromatin marks or DNA-interaction protein binding sites, there is not yet an integrated software agent that processes automatically algebra combinations of raw data sequencing into a comprehensive final annotated report of predicted superenhancers. Results: We have developed NaviSE, a user-friendly streamlined agent which performs a fully-automated parallel processing of genome-wide epigenomics data from sequencing files into a final report, built with a comprehensive set of annotated files that are navigated through a graphic user interface dynamically generated by NaviSE. NaviSE also implements an 'epigenomics signal algebra' that allows the combination of multiple activation and repression epigenomics signals. NaviSE provides an interactive chromosomal landscaping of the locations of superenhancers, which can be navigated to obtain annotated information about superenhancer signal profile, associated genes, gene ontology enrichment analysis, motifs of transcription factor binding sites enriched in superenhancers, graphs of the metrics evaluating the superenhancers quality, protein-protein interaction networks and enriched metabolic pathways among other features. We have parallelised the most time-consuming tasks achieving a reduction up to 30% for a 15 CPUs machine. We have optimized the default parameters of NaviSE to facilitate its use. NaviSE allows different entry levels of data processing, from sra-fastq files to bed files; and unifies the processing of multiple replicates. NaviSE outperforms the more time-consuming processes required in a non-integrated pipeline. Alongside its high performance, NaviSE is able to provide biological insights, predicting cell type specific markers, such as SOX2 and ZIC3 in embryonic stem cells, CDK5R1 and REST in neurons and CD86 and TLR2 in monocytes. Conclusions: NaviSE is a user-friendly streamlined solution for superenhancer analysis, annotation and navigation, requiring only basic computer and next generation sequencing knowledge. NaviSE binaries and documentation are available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/navise-superenhancer/.",

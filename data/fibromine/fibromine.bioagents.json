                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lethal lung fibroproliferative disease with limited therapeutic options. Differential expression profiling of affected sites has been instrumental for involved pathogenetic mechanisms dissection and therapeutic targets discovery. However, there have been limited efforts to comparatively analyse/mine the numerous related publicly available datasets, to fully exploit their potential on the validation/creation of novel research hypotheses. In this context and towards that goal, we present Fibromine, an integrated database and exploration environment comprising of consistently re-analysed, manually curated transcriptomic and proteomic pulmonary fibrosis datasets covering a wide range of experimental designs in both patients and animal models. Fibromine can be accessed via an R Shiny application (http://www.fibromine.com/Fibromine) which offers dynamic data exploration and real-time integration functionalities. Moreover, we introduce a novel benchmarking system based on transcriptomic datasets underlying characteristics, resulting to dataset accreditation aiming to aid the user on dataset selection. Cell specificity of gene expression can be visualised and/or explored in several scRNA-seq datasets, in an effort to link legacy data with this cutting-edge methodology and paving the way to their integration. Several use case examples are presented, that, importantly, can be reproduced on-the-fly by a non-specialist user, the primary target and potential user of this endeavour.",

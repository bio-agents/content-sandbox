description: Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE and UMAP described
  by Narayan et al. (2020). The non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques t-SNE
  and UMAP enable users to summarise complex high-dimensional sequencing data such
  as single cell RNAseq using lower dimensional representations. These lower dimensional
  representations enable the visualisation of discrete transcriptional states, as
  well as continuous trajectory (for example, in early development). However, these
  methods focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In some cases, this
  results in misleading visualisations, where the density of cells in the low-dimensional
  embedding does not represent the transcriptional heterogeneity of data in the original
  high-dimensional space. den-SNE and densMAP aim to enable more accurate visual interpretation
  of high-dimensional datasets by producing lower-dimensional embeddings that accurately
  represent the heterogeneity of the original high-dimensional space, enabling the
  identification of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell states. This accuracy is accomplished
  by including in the optimisation process a term which considers the local density
  of points in the original high-dimensional space. This can help to create visualisations
  that are more representative of heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: TDAview is an online agent for topological data analysis (TDA) and visualization. It implements the Mapper algorithm for TDA and provides extensive graph visualization options. TDAview is a user-friendly agent that allows biologists and clinicians without programming knowledge to harness the power of TDA. TDAview supports an analysis and visualization mode in which a Mapper graph is constructed based on user-specified parameters, followed by graph visualization. It can also be used in a visualization only mode in which TDAview is used for visualizing the data properties of a Mapper graph generated using other open-source software. The graph visualization options allow data exploration by graphical display of metadata variable values for nodes and edges, as well as the generation of publishable figures. TDAview can handle large datasets, with tens of thousands of data points, and thus has a wide range of applications for high-dimensional data, including the construction of topology-based gene co-expression networks.",

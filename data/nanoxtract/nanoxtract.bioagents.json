KGaA, WeinheimZeta potential is one of the most critical properties of nanomaterials (NMs) which provides an estimation of the surface charge, and therefore electrostatic stability in medium and, in practical terms, influences the NM's tendency to form agglomerates and to interact with cellular membranes. This paper describes a robust and accurate read-across model to predict NM zeta potential utilizing as the input data a set of image descriptors derived from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the NMs. The image descriptors are calculated using NanoXtract (http://enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/EnalosWebApps/NanoXtract/), a unique online agent that generates 18 image descriptors from the TEM images, which can then be explored by modeling to identify those most predictive of NM behavior and biological effects. NM TEM images are used to develop a model for prediction of zeta potential based on grouping of the NMs according to their nearest neighbors. The model provides interesting insights regarding the most important similarity features between NMs—in addition to core composition the main elongation emerged, which links to key drivers of NM toxicity such as aspect ratio. Both the NanoXtract image analysis agent and the validated model for zeta potential (http://enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/EnalosWebApps/ZetaPotential/) are freely available online through the Enalos Nanoinformatics platform.",

description: Automated system that provides dynamic genome annotations for custom
  input files that contain transcriptomic regions, which can be peak regions detected
  by clip-seq analysis (that detect protein-rna interactions), rna modifications (alias
  the epitranscriptome), cage-tag locations, or any other collection of target regions
  at the level of the transcriptome. it is designed as a reporting agent for the functional
  analysis of rna-binding sites detected by high-throughput experiments.

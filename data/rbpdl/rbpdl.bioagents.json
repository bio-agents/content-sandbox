                "abstract": "Â© 2013 IEEE.RNA-binding protein (RBP) is a powerful and wide-ranging regulator that plays an important role in cell development, differentiation, metabolism, health and disease. The prediction of RBPs provides valuable guidance for biologists. Although experimental methods have made great progress in predicting RBP, they are time-consuming and not flexible. Therefore, we developed a network model, rBPDL, by combining a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory for multilabel classification of RBPs. Moreover, to achieve better prediction results, we used a voting algorithm for ensemble learning of the model. We compared rBPDL with state-of-the-art methods and found that rBPDL significantly improved identification performance for the RBP68 dataset, with a macro-Area Under Curve (AUC), micro-AUC, and weighted AUC of 0.936, 0.962, and 0.946, respectively. Furthermore, through AUC statistical analysis of the RBP domain, we analyzed the performance of rBPDL and found that the RBP identification performance in the same domain was similar. In addition, we analyzed the performance preferences and physicochemical properties of the binding protein amino acids and explored the characteristics that affect the binding by using the RBP86 dataset.",

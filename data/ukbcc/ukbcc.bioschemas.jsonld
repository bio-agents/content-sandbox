The agent can filter the main and associated datasets (e.g general practioner clinical data) based on search terms provided by the user. It can be used interactively through a web-based interface, a command line interface, or imported as a module and integrated into a broader pipeline. Additional functionality, such as automatically downloading large data files (bulk data) is also supported.",

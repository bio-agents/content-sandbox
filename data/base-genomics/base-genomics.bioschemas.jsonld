      "sc:description": "BASE is a workflow to integrate non-ubiquitous genes in comparative genomics analyses for selection. It is used to built to ease the inference and interpretation of selection regimes in the context of comparative genomics. While the majority of these analyses are restricted to ortholog groups of ubiquitous genes - i.e. genes which are present in all the species considered - BASE allows to integrate ortholog groups of non-ubiquitous genes - i.e. genes which are not present in all the species considered.",

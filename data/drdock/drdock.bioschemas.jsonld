      "sc:description": "DRDOCK is a drug repurposing platform integrating automated docking, simulations and a log-odds-based drug ranking scheme. DRDOCK performs online automatic virtual drug screening of 2016 FDA-approved drugs on a user-submitted target protein. Its goal is to facilitate the drug repurposing to extend the possible treatments toward life-threaten and epidemic diseases. This is achieved by combining the molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to prioritize drugs of strong binders from non-binder. The only things the user required to provide are a well-patched protein structure made of a single peptide chain in PDB format and the target residues IDs to which the drugs expected to bind.",

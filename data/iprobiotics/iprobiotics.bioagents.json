All rights reserved.Lactic acid bacteria consortia are commonly present in food, and some of these bacteria possess probiotic properties. However, discovery and experimental validation of probiotics require extensive time and effort. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop effective screening methods for identifying probiotics. Advances in sequencing technology have generated massive genomic data, enabling us to create a machine learning-based platform for such purpose in this work. This study first selected a comprehensive probiotics genome dataset from the probiotic database (PROBIO) and literature surveys. Then, k-mer (from 2 to 8) compositional analysis was performed, revealing diverse oligonucleotide composition in strain genomes and apparently more probiotic (P-) features in probiotic genomes than non-probiotic genomes. To reduce noise and improve computational efficiency, 87 376 k-mers were refined by an incremental feature selection (IFS) method, and the model achieved the maximum accuracy level at 184 core features, with a high prediction accuracy (97.77%) and area under the curve (98.00%). Functional genomic analysis using annotations from gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) databases, as well as analysis of genes associated with host gastrointestinal survival/settlement, carbohydrate utilization, drug resistance and virulence factors, revealed that the distribution of P-features was biased toward genes/pathways related to probiotic function. Our results suggest that the role of probiotics is not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of k-mer genomic components, providing new insights into the identification and underlying mechanisms of probiotics. This work created a novel and free online bioinformatic agent, iProbiotics, which would facilitate rapid screening for probiotics.",

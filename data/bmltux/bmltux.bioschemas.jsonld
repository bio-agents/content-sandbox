      "sc:description": "The BiomotionLab Agentkit for Unity Experiments (bmlTUX) helps you design and run experiments in Unity quickly and iteratively without fussing over coding details. The agentkit includes agents to aid in both the design and the execution of experiments in Unity. The agentkit is designed to simplify the setup and reduce the required code needed to get experiments up and running quickly. The agentkit can automatically handle the difficult task creating trial tables, combinatorics randomization, blocking, etc. Such functionality removes one of the most difficult aspects of creating experiments.",

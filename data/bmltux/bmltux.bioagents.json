    "description": "The BiomotionLab Agentkit for Unity Experiments (bmlTUX) helps you design and run experiments in Unity quickly and iteratively without fussing over coding details. The agentkit includes agents to aid in both the design and the execution of experiments in Unity. The agentkit is designed to simplify the setup and reduce the required code needed to get experiments up and running quickly. The agentkit can automatically handle the difficult task creating trial tables, combinatorics randomization, blocking, etc. Such functionality removes one of the most difficult aspects of creating experiments.",

                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2020.Advances in virtual reality technology have made it a valuable new agent for vision and perception researchers. Coding virtual reality experiments from scratch can be difficult and time-consuming, so researchers rely on software such as Unity game engine to create and edit virtual scenes. However, Unity lacks built-in agents for controlling experiments. Existing third-party add-ins requires complicated scripts to define experiments. This can be difficult and requires advanced coding knowledge, especially for multifactorial experimental designs. In this article, we describe a new free and open-source agent called the BiomotionLab Agentkit for Unity Experiments (bmlTUX) that provides a simple interface for controlling experiments in Unity. In contrast to existing agents, bmlTUX provides a graphical interface to automatically handle combinatorics, counterbalancing, randomization, mixed designs, and blocking of trial order. The agentbox works out-of-the-box since simple experiments can be created with almost no coding. Furthermore, multiple design configurations can be swapped with a drag-and-drop interface allowing researchers to test new configurations iteratively while maintaining the ability to easily revert to previous configurations. Despite its simplicity, bmlTUX remains highly flexible and customizable, catering to coding novices and experts alike.",

description: Correspondence analysis (CA) is a matrix factorization method, and is
  similar to principal components analysis (PCA). Whereas PCA is designed for application
  to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is appropriate for non-negative,
  count-based data that are in the same additive scale. The corral package implements
  CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of single-cell data, as well
  as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages data-optimized scaling to align
  data generated from different sequencing platforms by projecting into a shared latent
  space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a fast implementation of SVD, and can
  be called directly on Bioconductor objects (e.g., SingleCellExperiment) for easy
  pipeline integration. The package also includes the option to apply CA-style processing
  to continuous data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance
  adaptation of CA.

                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Elsevier LtdProtein mapping distributes many copies of different molecular probes on the surface of a target protein in order to determine binding hot spots, regions that are highly preferable for ligand binding. While mapping of X-ray structures by the FTMap server is inherently static, this limitation can be overcome by the simultaneous analysis of multiple structures of the protein. FTMove is an automated web server that implements this approach. From the input of a target protein, by PDB code, the server identifies all structures of the protein available in the PDB, runs mapping on them, and combines the results to form binding hot spots and binding sites. The user may also upload their own protein structures, bypassing the PDB search for similar structures. Output of the server consists of the consensus binding sites and the individual mapping results for each structure - including the number of probes located in each binding site, for each structure. This level of detail allows the users to investigate how the strength of a binding site relates to the protein conformation, other binding sites, and the presence of ligands or mutations. In addition, the structures are clustered on the basis of their binding properties. The use of FTMove is demonstrated by application to 22 proteins with known allosteric binding sites; the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites were identified in all but one case, and the sites were typically ranked among the top five. The FTMove server is publicly available at https://ftmove.bu.edu.",

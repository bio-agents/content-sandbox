      "sc:description": "DysRegSig is an R package for identifying gene dysregulations and building mechanistic signatures in cancer. DysRegSig is capable of robustly exploring gene dysregulations from high-dimensional expression data with cooperativity and synergy between regulators and several other transcriptional regulation rules taken into consideration. DysRegSig also offers agents to rank dysregulated regulations and TFs, and construct mechanistic signature with gene dysregulations by using genetic algorithm.",

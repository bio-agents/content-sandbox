                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Current gene regulatory network (GRN) inference methods are notorious for a great number of indirect interactions hidden in the predictions. Filtering out the indirect interactions from direct ones remains an important challenge in the reconstruction of GRNs. To address this issue, we developed a redundancy silencing and network enhancement technique (RSNET) for inferring GRNs. Results: To assess the performance of RSNET method, we implemented the experiments on several gold-standard networks by using simulation study, DREAM challenge dataset and Escherichia coli network. The results show that RSNET method performed better than the compared methods in sensitivity and accuracy. As a case of study, we used RSNET to construct functional GRN for apple fruit ripening from gene expression data. Conclusions: In the proposed method, the redundant interactions including weak and indirect connections are silenced by recursive optimization adaptively, and the highly dependent nodes are constrained in the model to keep the real interactions. This study provides a useful agent for inferring clean networks.",

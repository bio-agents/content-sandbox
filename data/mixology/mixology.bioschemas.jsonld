      "sc:description": "A agent for calculating required masses and volumes for laboratory solutions.\n\nSimple calculator for weighing out components of media/buffers/etc.\n\nMixology is a agent that makes it easy to calculate the ingredients needed for media, buffers, etc. First you enter the final volume of buffer at the top. Then on the left hand side you enter the concentrations desired, in any units (mg/ul, uM, % v/v, etc.). The amounts you need to measure out will appear on the right hand side, in the units that you enter there. Mixology automatically extracts molecular weights from ChEBI to make these calculations as smooth as possible.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Motivation: Percent Spliced-In (PSI) values are commonly used to report alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) changes. Previous PSI-detection agents were limited to specific AS events and were evaluated by in silico RNA-seq data. We developed PSI-Sigma, which uses a new PSI index, and we employed actual (non-simulated) RNA-seq data from spliced synthetic genes (RNA Sequins) to benchmark its performance (i.e. precision, recall, false positive rate and correlation) in comparison with three leading agents (rMATS, SUPPA2 and Whippet). Results: PSI-Sigma outperformed these agents, especially in the case of AS events with multiple alternative exons and intron-retention events. We also briefly evaluated its performance in long-read RNA-seq analysis, by sequencing a mixture of human RNAs and RNA Sequins with nanopore long-read sequencers. Availability and implementation: PSI-Sigma is implemented is available at https://github.com/wososa/PSI-Sigma.",

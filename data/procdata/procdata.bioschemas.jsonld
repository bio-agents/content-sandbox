      "sc:description": "Provides agents for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to the data describing participants' problem-solving processes in computer-based assessments. It is often recorded in computer log files. This package provides functions to read, process, and write process data. It also implements two feature extraction methods to compress the information stored in process data into standard numerical vectors. This package also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate response processes with other binary or scale variables of interest. The functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks are wrappers of functions in 'keras'.",

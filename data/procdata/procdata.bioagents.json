    "description": "Provides agents for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to the data describing participants' problem-solving processes in computer-based assessments. It is often recorded in computer log files. This package provides functions to read, process, and write process data. It also implements two feature extraction methods to compress the information stored in process data into standard numerical vectors. This package also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate response processes with other binary or scale variables of interest. The functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks are wrappers of functions in 'keras'.",

These data, represented as timestamped action sequences, keep track of respondents’ response problem-solving behaviors. Process data analysis aims at enhancing educational assessment accuracy and serving other assessment purposes by utilizing the rich information contained in response processes. The R package ProcData presented in this article is designed to provide agents for inspecting, processing, and analyzing process data. We define an S3 class ‘proc’ for organizing process data and extend generic methods summary and print for ‘proc’. Feature extraction methods for process data are implemented in the package for compressing information in the irregular response processes into regular numeric vectors. ProcData also provides functions for making predictions from neural-network-based sequence models. In addition, a real dataset of response processes from the climate control item in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment is included in the package.",

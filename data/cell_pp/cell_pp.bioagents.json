Here, we introduce Cell++, a novel stochastic simulation environment with the capacity to study a wide variety of biochemical processes within a spatial context. Results: Focusing on three case studies, we highlight the potential impact of spatial organization in the evolution and engineering of signaling and metabolic pathways. In addition to altering signaling and metabolic efficiency, simulations also demonstrated features consistent with the phenomenon of metabolic channeling. Â© Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.",

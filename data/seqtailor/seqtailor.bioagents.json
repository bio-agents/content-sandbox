                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Human whole-genome-sequencing reveals about 4 000 000 genomic variants per individual. These data are mostly stored as VCF-format files. Although many variant analysis methods accept VCF as input, many other agents require DNA or protein sequences, particularly for splicing prediction, sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and structure prediction. However, there is no existing webserver capable of extracting DNA/protein sequences for genomic variants from VCF files in a user-friendly and efficient manner. We developed the SeqTailor webserver to bridge this gap, by enabling rapid extraction of (i) DNA sequences around genomic variants, with customizable window sizes and options to annotate the splice sites closest to the variants and to consider the neighboring variants within the window; and (ii) protein sequences encoded by the DNA sequences around genomic variants, with built-in SnpEff annotator and customizable window sizes. SeqTailor supports 11 species, including: human (GRCh37/GRCh38), chimpanzee, mouse, rat, cow, chicken, lizard, zebrafish, fruitfly, Arabidopsis and rice. Standalone programs are provided for command-line-based needs. SeqTailor streamlines the sequence extraction process, and accelerates the analysis of genomic variants with software requiring DNA/protein sequences. It will facilitate the study of genomic variation, by increasing the feasibility of sequence-based analysis and prediction. The SeqTailor webserver is freely available at http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/SeqTailor/.",

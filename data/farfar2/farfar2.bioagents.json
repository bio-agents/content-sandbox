                "abstract": "© 2020 Elsevier LtdPredicting RNA three-dimensional structures from sequence could accelerate understanding of the growing number of RNA molecules being discovered across biology. Rosetta's Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full-Atom Refinement (FARFAR) has shown promise in community-wide blind RNA-Puzzle trials, but lack of a systematic and automated benchmark has left unclear what limits FARFAR performance. Here, we benchmark FARFAR2, an algorithm integrating RNA-Puzzle-inspired innovations with updated fragment libraries and helix modeling. In 16 of 21 RNA-Puzzles revisited without experimental data or expert intervention, FARFAR2 recovers native-like structures more accurate than models submitted during the RNA-Puzzles trials. Remaining bottlenecks include conformational sampling for >80-nucleotide problems and scoring function limitations more generally. Supporting these conclusions, preregistered blind models for adenovirus VA-I RNA and five riboswitch complexes predicted native-like folds with 3- to 14 Å root-mean-square deviation accuracies. We present a FARFAR2 webserver and three large model archives (FARFAR2-Classics, FARFAR2-Motifs, and FARFAR2-Puzzles) to guide future applications and advances. © 2020 Elsevier LtdWatkins et al. benchmark FARFAR2, an algorithm for RNA structure prediction that consolidates a decade of ad hoc strategies. FARFAR2 recovers native-like structures more accurately than original challenge submissions for 16 of 21 RNA-Puzzles and achieves native-like preregistered blind predictions for adenovirus VA-I RNA and five riboswitch complexes.",

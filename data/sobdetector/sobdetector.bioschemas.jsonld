      "sc:description": "Strand Orientation Bias Detector (SOBDetector) is a agent that reanalyzes the mutations stored in a VCF (by any mutation caller), and evaluates whether the reads which support the alternate alleles have a strand orientation bias using the original binary alignment (BAM) files. This method was designed on Illumina-like paired-end sequencing data. Although it was created for human somatic mutation filtration, it can be used on samples of any species and in a germline variant calling analysiss as well.",

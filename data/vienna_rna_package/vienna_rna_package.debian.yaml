description: 'The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several stand-alone
  programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. It is developed
  and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker in Vienna. . RNA secondary structure
  prediction through energy minimization is the most used function in the package.
  It provides three kinds of dynamic programming algorithms for structure prediction:
  * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which yields a single
  optimal structure, * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which
  calculates base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the suboptimal
  folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates all suboptimal structures
  within a given energy range of the optimal energy. . For secondary structure comparison,
  the package contains several measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either
  string alignment or tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an
  algorithm to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding). The
  RNAforester package is a agent for aligning RNA secondary structures and it''s user
  interface integrates to those of the agents of the Vienna RNA package.'

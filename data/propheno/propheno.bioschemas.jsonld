      "sc:description": "An online dataset for accelerating the complete characterization of the human protein-phenotype landscape in biomedical literature.\n\nIdentifying protein-phenotype relations is of paramount importance for applications such as uncovering rare and complex diseases. One of the best resources that captures the protein-phenotype relationships is the biomedical literature. In this work, we introduce ProPheno, a comprehensive online dataset composed of human protein phenotype mentions extracted from the complete corpora of Medline and PubMed Central Open Access. Moreover, it includes co-occurrences of protein-phenotype pairs within different spans of text such as sentences and paragraphs. We use ProPheno for completely characterizing the human protein-phenotype landscape in biomedical literature",

      "sc:description": "Quantification of translation uncovers the functions of the alternative transcriptome.\n\nAn R package for Splice-aware quantification of translation using Ribo-seq data.\n\nORFquant is an R package that aims at detecting and quantifiying ORF translation on complex transcriptomes using Ribo-seq data. This package uses syntax and functions present in Bioconductor packages like GenomicFeatures, rtracklayer or BSgenome. ORFquant aims at quantifying translation at the single ORF level taking into account the presence of multiple transcripts expressed by each gene. To do so, the ORFquant pipeline consists of transcript filtering, de-novo ORF finding, ORF quantification and ORF annotation. A variety of annotation methods, both in transcript and genomic space, is performed for each ORF, to yield a more complete picture of alternative splice sites usage, uORF translation, translation on NMD candidates and more.",

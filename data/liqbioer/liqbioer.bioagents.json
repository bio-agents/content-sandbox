Biomarkers in body fluids have gained considerable attention since the development of liquid biopsy, and their data volume is rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, current research lacks the compilation of published cancer body fluid biomarkers into a centralized and sustainable repository for researchers and clinicians, despite a handful of small-scale and specific data resources. To fulfill this purpose, we developed liquid biomarker (LiqBioer) containing 6231 manually curated records from 3447 studies, covering 3056 biomarkers and 74 types of cancer in 22 tissues. LiqBioer allows users to browse and download comprehensive information on body liquid biomarkers, including cancer types, source studies and clinical usage. As a comprehensive resource for body fluid biomarkers of cancer, LiqBioer is a powerful agent for researchers and clinicians to query and retrieve biomarkers in liquid biopsy.

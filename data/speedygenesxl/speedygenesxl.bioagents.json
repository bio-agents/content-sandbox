                "abstract": "© 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Directed evolution of proteins is a highly effective strategy for tailoring biocatalysts to a particular application, and is capable of engineering improvements such as kcat, thermostability and organic solvent tolerance. It is recognized that large and systematic libraries are required to navigate a protein’s vast and rugged sequence landscape effectively, yet their preparation is nontrivial and commercial libraries are extremely costly. To address this, we have developed SpeedyGenesXL, an automated, high-throughput platform for the production of wild-type genes, Boolean OR, combinatorial, or combinatorial-OR-type libraries based on the SpeedyGenes methodology. Together this offers a flexible platform for library synthesis, capable of generating many different bespoke, diverse libraries simultaneously.",

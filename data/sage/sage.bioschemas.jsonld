      "sc:description": "A comprehensive resource of genetic variants integrating South Asian whole genomes and exomes.\n\nSouth Asian Genomes and Exomes (CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology).\n\nSAGE is a comprehensive repertoire of genome and exome information from South Asians. We have integrated 6 datasets encompassing 1213 human genome and exome data to create a compendium of 154 million genetic variants. The resource has immense applications in understanding the allelic frequencies, carrier rates for rare genetic diseases and genetic traits including pharmacogenetics, apart from prioritising and discovering novel disease associated variants. The variants were systematically annotated, integrated with other public databases and and allele frequencies are available in this browsable resource. To know more please look in to the FAQ section.",

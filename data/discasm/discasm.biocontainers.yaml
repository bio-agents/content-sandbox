description: Discasm aims to extract reads that map to reference genomes in a discordant
  fashion and optionally include reads that do not map to the genome at all, and perform
  a de novo transcriptome assembly of these reads. discasm relies on the output from
  star (as run via star-fusion), and supports de novo transcriptome assembly using
  trinity or oases. - https://github.com/discasm/discasm/wiki

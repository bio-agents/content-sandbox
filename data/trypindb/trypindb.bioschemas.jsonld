Information of about >14,000 small molecules from >700 published research articles were collected and made as an easy-to-search database. Four major sets of information were made available for each collected inhibitors viz., General information (activity values; source of the inhibitors; enzyme targets; etc.,), Structural information, Toxicity information, and Literature information. More than 40 different information about each inhibitor were collected or predicted and made accessible for searching.",

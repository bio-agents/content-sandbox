      "sc:description": "DeepArk is a set of models of the worm, fish, fly, and mouse regulatory codes. For each of these organism, we constructed a deep convolutional neural network that predict regulatory activities (i.e. histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state) directly from genomic sequences. Besidese accurately predicting a sequence's regulatory activity, DeepArk can predict the effects of variants on regulatory function and profile sequences regulatory potential with in silico saturated mutagenesis.",

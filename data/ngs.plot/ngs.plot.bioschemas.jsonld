  "sc:description": "Program that allows you to easily visualize your next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples at functional genomic regions. The signature advantage of this agent is that it collects a large database of functional elements for many genomes. A user can ask for a functionally important region to be displayed in one command. It handles large sequencing data efficiently and has only modest memory requirement.",

    "description": "A agent for post-processing proteomics data providing differential expression metrics, co-expression networks and functional analytics.\n\nProTExA is a web-agent that provides a post-processing workflow for the analysis of protein and gene expression datasets. Using network-based bioinformatics approaches, ProTExA facilitates differential expression analysis and co-expression network analysis as well as pathway and post-pathway analysis. Specifically, for a given set of protein-gene expression data across samples, ProTExA: (1) performs statistical analysis and filtering to highlight the differentially expressed proteins-genes, (2) performs enrichment analysis to identify top-scored pathways, (3) generates pathway-to-pathway and pathway-to-gene networks (4) generates protein and gene co-expression networks using a variety of methodologies, and (5) applies clustering methodologies to identify sub-networks of co-expressed proteins-genes",

The proposed web-agent is a simple yet informative agent, towards understanding and exploitation of protein and gene expression datasets, especially for those that do not have the expertise and local resources to replicate specific analyses in the context of collaborative and scientific data exchanging.",

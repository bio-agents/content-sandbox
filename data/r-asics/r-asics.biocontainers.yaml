description: 'With a set of pure metabolite spectra, ASICS quantifies  metabolites
  concentration in a complex spectrum. The identification of  metabolites is performed
  by fitting a mixture model to the spectra of the library with a sparse penalty.
  The method and its statistical properties are  described in Tardivel et al. (2017)
  <doi:10.1007/s11306-017-1244-5>. '

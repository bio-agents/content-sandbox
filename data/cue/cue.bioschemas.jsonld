      "sc:description": "CpG impUtation Ensemble (CUE) is a method, which leverages multiple classical statistical and modern machine learning methods, to impute from the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip to the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (HM850) BeadChip. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one of the most extensively studied epigenetic marks. With technological advancements, geneticists can profile DNA methylation with multiple reliable approaches. However, different profiling platforms can differ substantially in the CpGs they assess, consequently hindering integrated analysis across platforms.",

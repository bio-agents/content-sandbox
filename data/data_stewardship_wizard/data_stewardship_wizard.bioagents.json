                "abstract": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis paper explores the openly available DMP agents and forms a comparative analysis aimed at assisting researchers and data managers to formulate effective data management plans. Based on a literature review 14 DMP agents were selected and were evaluated using 45 selected parameters. The study enlists and enunciates the features of DMP agents, spots several gaps in DMP practices, and provides a few recommendations that can improve the existing agents and DMP practices. Compared to other related works, present work sheds extra light on percentage coverage of parameters by each agent and percentage coverage of agents by each parameter. It is identified that selected agents cover 50%–84% parameters, whereas 78% parameters are covered by half the selected DMP agents. Moreover, 28% of the agents cover 60% of the DMP assisting parameters. Additionally, co-occurrence of parameters and correlation among the agents are illustrated using matrices. It was found that co-occurrence of data description/summary/collection, documentation and metadata, findability, and accessibility parameters are relatively higher and all the selected agents are positively correlated to each other. The study is impactful for the researchers, librarians, data managers, and funding agencies for selecting an appropriate DMP agent as per their requirement.",

The goal of this paper is to bring an overview of current state of the art of data management and data stewardship planning solutions (DMP). We begin by arguing why data management is an important vehicle supporting adoption and implementation of the FAIR principles, we describe the background, context and historical development, as well as major driving forces, being research initiatives and funders. Then we provide an overview of the current leading DMP agents in the form of a table presenting the key characteristics. Next, we elaborate on emerging common standards for DMPs, especially the topic of machine-actionable DMPs. As sound DMP is not only a precursor of FAIR data stewardship, but also an integral part of it, we discuss its positioning in the emerging FAIR agents ecosystem. Capacity building and training activities are an important ingredient in the whole effort. Although not being the primary goal of this paper, we touch also the topic of research workforce support, as agents can be just as much effective as their users are competent to use them properly. We conclude by discussing the relations of DMP to FAIR principles, as there are other important connections than just being a precursor.",

It is based on FAIR Data Stewardship, in which each data-related decision in a project acts to optimize the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and/or Reusability of the data. The background to this philosophy is that the first reuser of the data is the researcher themselves. The agent encourages the consulting of expertise and experts, can help researchers avoid risks they did not know they would encounter by confronting them with practical experience from others, and can help them discover helpful technologies they did not know existed. In this paper, we discuss the context and motivation for the agent, we explain its architecture and we present key functions, such as the knowledge model evolvability and migrations, assembling data management plans, metrics and evaluation of data management plans.",

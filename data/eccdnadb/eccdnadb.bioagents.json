                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) elements are circular DNA molecules that are derived from but are independent of chromosomal DNA. EccDNA is emerging as a rising star because of its ubiquitous existence in cancers and its crucial role in oncogene amplification and tumor progression. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of cancer samples were downloaded from public repositories. Afterwards, eccDNAs were identified from WGS data via bioinformatic analyses. To leverage database coverage, eccDNAs were also collected by manual curation of literatures. Gene expression and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and CCLE and then used to investigate the roles of eccDNAs in cancers. Finally, the first integrated database of eccDNAs, eccDNAdb, was developed. eccDNAdb currently includes 1270 eccDNAs, which were identified in 480 samples (of 42 cancers) after analyzing a total number of 3395 tumor samples (of 57 cancers) including patient tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and cancer cell lines. A total number of 54,901 eccDNA genes were annotated and included in the database as well. With the integration of gene expression, clinical information and chromatin accessibility data, eccDNAdb enables users to easily determine the biological function and clinical relevance of eccDNAs in human cancers. In conclusion, eccDNAdb is freely accessible at http://www.eccdnadb.org. To our knowledge, eccDNAdb is the first database in the eccDNA research field. It is expected to provide insight for novel cancer therapies.",

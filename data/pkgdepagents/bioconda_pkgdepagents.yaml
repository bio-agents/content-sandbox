description: This package provides agents for computing and analyzing dependency relationships
  among R packages.  It provides agents for building a graph-based representation of
  the dependencies among all packages in a list of CRAN-style package repositories.  There
  are also utilities for computing installation order of a given package.  If the
  RCurl package is available, an estimate of the download size required to install
  a given package and its dependencies can be obtained.

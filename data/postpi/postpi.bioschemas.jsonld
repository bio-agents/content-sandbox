      "sc:description": "Post-prediction inference.\n\nMany modern problems leverage machine learning methods to predict outcomes based on observable covariates. In the subsequent statistical modeling, e.g. to understand population trends in outcomes, often involves treating predicted outcomes as interchangeable with observed outcomes. This leads to biases in the downstream inference results due to the reason that machine learning models capture the mean function well but not the variance. postpi is an R package we developed to correct such biases in the downstream inferential analyses using outcomes predicted with an arbitrary machine learning method.",

These networks are bipartite graphs linking either transcription factors (TFs) or miRNAs to their target genes. GRAND includes an integrated webserver to test for enrichment of a list of TFs in a set of libraries as well as a agent (CLUEreg) to find compounds that reverse/exacerbate a gene or TF regulatory profile.",

                "abstract": "Copyright © 2022 Jia, Wu and Qiu.Being a new type of widespread protein post-translational modifications discovered in recent years, succinylation plays a key role in protein conformational regulation and cellular function regulation. Numerous studies have shown that succinylation modifications are closely associated with the development of many diseases. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of succinylation, it is vital to identify lysine succinylation sites. However, experimental identification of succinylation sites is time-consuming and laborious, and traditional identification agents are unable to meet the rapid growth of datasets. Therefore, to solve this problem, we developed a new predictor named pSuc-FFSEA, which can predict succinylation sites in protein sequences by feature fusion and stacking ensemble algorithm. Specifically, the sequence information and physicochemical properties were first extracted using EBGW, One-Hot, continuous bag-of-words, chaos game representation, and AAF_DWT. Following that, feature selection was performed, which applied LASSO to select the optimal subset of features for the classifier, and then, stacking ensemble classifier was designed using two-layer stacking ensemble, selecting three classifiers, SVM, broad learning system and LightGBM classifier, as the base classifiers of the first layer, using logistic regression classifier as the meta classifier of the second layer. In order to further improve the model prediction accuracy and reduce the computational effort, bayesian optimization algorithm and grid search algorithm were utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier. Finally, the results of rigorous 10-fold cross-validation indicated our predictor showed excellent robustness and performed better than the previous prediction agents, which achieved an average prediction accuracy of 0.7773 ± 0.0120. Besides, for the convenience of the most experimental scientists, a user-friendly and comprehensive web-server for pSuc-FFSEA has been established at https://bio.cangmang.xyz/pSuc-FFSEA, by which one can easily obtain the expected data and results without going through the complicated mathematics.",

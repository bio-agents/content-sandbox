                "abstract": "© 2022 The AuthorsProtein stability is a requisite for most biotechnological and medical applications of proteins. As natural proteins tend to suffer from a low conformational stability ex vivo, great efforts have been devoted toward increasing their stability through rational design and engineering of appropriate mutations. Unfortunately, even the best currently used predictors fail to compute the stability of protein variants with sufficient accuracy and their usefulness as agents to guide the rational stabilisation of proteins is limited. We present here Protposer, a protein stabilising agent based on a different approach. Instead of quantifying changes in stability, Protposer uses structure- and sequence-based screening modules to nominate candidate mutations for subsequent evaluation by a logistic regression model, carefully trained to avoid overfitting. Thus, Protposer analyses PDB files in search for stabilization opportunities and provides a ranked list of promising mutations with their estimated success rates (eSR), their probabilities of being stabilising by at least 0.5 kcal/mol. The agreement between eSRs and actual positive predictive values (PPV) on external datasets of mutations is excellent. When Protposer is used with its Optimal kappa selection threshold, its PPV is above 0.7. Even with less stringent thresholds, Protposer largely outperforms FoldX, Rosetta and PoPMusiC. Indicating the PDB file of the protein suffices to obtain a ranked list of mutations, their eSRs and hints on the likely source of the stabilization expected. Protposer is a distinct, straightforward and highly successful agent to design protein stabilising mutations, and it is freely available for academic use at http://webapps.bifi.es/the-protposer.",

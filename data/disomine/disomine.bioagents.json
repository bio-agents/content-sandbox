                "abstract": "© 2022 Elsevier LtdThe role of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) in cellular processes has become increasingly evident over the last years. These IDRs continue to challenge structural biology experiments because they lack a well-defined conformation, and bioinformatics approaches that accurately delineate disordered protein regions remain essential for their identification and further investigation. Typically, these predictors use the protein amino acid sequence, without taking into account likely sequence-dependent emergent properties, such as protein backbone dynamics. Here we present DisoMine, a method that predicts protein'long disorder’ with recurrent neural networks from simple predictions of protein dynamics, secondary structure and early folding. The agent is fast and requires only a single sequence, making it applicable for large-scale screening, including poorly studied and orphan proteins. DisoMine is a top performer in its category and compares well to disorder prediction approaches using evolutionary information.

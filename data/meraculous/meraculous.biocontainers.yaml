description: 'Meraculous is a whole genome assembler for Next Generation Sequencing
  data geared for large genomes. It is a hybrid k-mer/read-based assembler that capitalizes
  on the high accuracy of Illumina sequence by eschewing an explicit error correction
  step which we argue to be redundant with the assembly process. '

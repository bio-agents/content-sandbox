CIE provides a user-friendly web-app and an R-package to run inference queries on casual regulatory netowrks. Several regulatory networks are provided in the platform, including a TF-gene intraction network constructed from ChIP-seq and tissue specific gene expression data, a netowrk based on STRING-DB, and curated TF-gene interaction networks such as TRRUST and TRED. The R-package provides functionality for custom networks as well.\n\nCausal Inference Engine: Directional Enrichment Analysis on Biological Networks.",

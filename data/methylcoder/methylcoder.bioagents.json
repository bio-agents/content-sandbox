                "abstract": "Motivation: MethylCoder is a software program that generates per-base methylation data given a set of bisulte-treated reads. It provides the option to use either of two existing short-read aligners, each with different strengths. It accounts for soft-masked alignments and overlapping paired-end reads. MethylCoder outputs data in text and binary formats in addition to the nal alignment in SAM format, so that common high-throughput sequencing agents can be used on the resulting output. It is more exible than existing software and competitive in terms of speed and memory use. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",

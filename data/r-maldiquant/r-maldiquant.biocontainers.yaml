description: A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight
  (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly\nused
  plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline\nsubtraction
  methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive\nnon-linear
  iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping\nfunctions,
  handling of replicated measurements as well as allowing spectra with\ndifferent
  resolutions.

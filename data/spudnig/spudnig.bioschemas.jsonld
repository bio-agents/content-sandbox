A working version of the application can be downloaded here. SPUDNIG is created during my MSc thesis project at the Max Planck Institute Nijmegen. SPUDNIG's purpose is to speed up annotation work of hand gestures in Elan. SPUDNIG takes as input a video file and extracts the gestures and their timing.",

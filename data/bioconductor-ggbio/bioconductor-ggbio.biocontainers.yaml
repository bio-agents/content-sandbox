description: The package extends and specializes the grammar of graphics for biological
  data. the graphics are designed to answer common scientific questions, those often
  asked of high throughput genomics data. all core bioconductor appropriate data structures
  are supported. the package supports detailed views of genomic regions and genome-wide
  overviews. high-level plots include sequence fragment length, edge-linked interval
  to data view, mismatch pileup, and several splicing summaries.

For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Human papillomavirus (HPV) integrating into human genome is the main cause of cervical carcinogenesis. HPV integration selection preference shows strong dependence on local genomic environment. Due to this theory, it is possible to predict HPV integration sites. However, a published bioinformatic agent is not available to date. Thus, we developed an attention-based deep learning model DeepHPV to predict HPV integration sites by learning environment features automatically. In total, 3608 known HPV integration sites were applied to train the model, and 584 reviewed HPV integration sites were used as the testing dataset. DeepHPV showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.6336 and an area under the precision recall (AUPR) of 0.5670. Adding RepeatMasker and TCGA Pan Cancer peaks improved the model performance to 0.8464 and 0.8501 in AUROC and 0.7985 and 0.8106 in AUPR, respectively. Next, we tested these trained models on independent database VISDB and found the model adding TCGA Pan Cancer performed better (AUROC: 0.7175, AUPR: 0.6284) than the model adding RepeatMasker peaks (AUROC: 0.6102, AUPR: 0.5577). Moreover, we introduced attention mechanism in DeepHPV and enriched the transcription factor binding sites including BHLHA15, CHR, COUP-TFII, DMRTA2, E2A, HIC1, INR, NPAS, Nr5a2, RARa, SCL, Snail1, Sox10, Sox3, Sox4, Sox6, STAT6, Tbet, Tbx5, TEAD, Tgif2, ZNF189, ZNF416 near attention intensive sites. Together, DeepHPV is a robust and explainable deep learning model, providing new insights into HPV integration preference and mechanism.

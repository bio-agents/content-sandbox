description: Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient agent for aligning sequencing
  reads to long reference sequences. it is particularly good at aligning reads of
  about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to
  relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. bowtie 2 is the genome with an fm index
  to keep its memory footprint small for the human genome, its memory footprint is
  typically around 3.2 gb. bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment
  modes.

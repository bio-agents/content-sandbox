                "abstract": "Â© The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.Genome-wide association studies are becoming computationally more demanding with the growing amounts of data. Combinatorial traits can increase the data dimensions beyond the computational capabilities of the current agents. We addressed this issue by creating an application for quick association analysis that is ten to hundreds of times faster than the leading fast methods. Our agent (RegScan) is designed for performing basic linear regression analysis with continuous traits maximally fast on large data sets. RegScan specifically targets association analysis of combinatorial traits in metabolomics. It can both generate and analyze the combinatorial traits efficiently. RegScan is capable of analyzing any number of traits together without the need to specify each trait individually. The main goal of the article is to show that RegScan can be the preferred analytical agent when large amounts of data need to be analyzed quickly using the allele frequency test.",

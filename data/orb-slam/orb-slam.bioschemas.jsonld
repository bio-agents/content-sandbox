Our method extends the ORB-SLAM2 framework with the enhanced unified camera model (EUCM) as a projection function, which can be applied to catadioptric systems and wide-angle fisheye cameras. Without rectifying or cropping the input images, the proposed system can use the full area of the images even with strong distortion.",

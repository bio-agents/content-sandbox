description: This is the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for working with virus sequencing
  data, sequenced with nanopore. It implements a complete bioinformatics protocol
  to take the output from the Nanopore sequencer and determine consensus genome sequences.
  Includes basecalling, de-multiplexing, mapping, polishing and consensus generation.
  . An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, ... something unknown? This software is field-proven.

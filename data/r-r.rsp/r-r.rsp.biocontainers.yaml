description: The RSP markup language makes any text-based document come alive. RSP
  provides a powerful markup for controlling the content and output of LaTeX, HTML,
  Markdown, AsciiDoc, Sweave and knitr documents (and more). Contrary to many other
  literate programming languages, with RSP it is straightforward to loop over mixtures
  of code and text sections, e.g. in month-by-month summaries. RSP has also several
  preprocessing directives for incorporating static and dynamic contents of external
  files (local or online) among other things. Functions rstring() and rcat() make
  it easy to process RSP strings, rsource() sources an RSP file as it was an R script,
  while rfile() compiles it (even online) into its final output format. RSP is ideal
  for self-contained scientific reports and R package vignettes.

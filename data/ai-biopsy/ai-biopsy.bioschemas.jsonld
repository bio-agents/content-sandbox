The files for pre-trained models are available under the column named \"Checkpoint\".\n\nFor accurate results, we recommend the use of axial images with a visible prostate gland. Also, 7 slices per patient are used in voting system to measure the accuracy of the trained model for individual patients.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'h4AI-biopsy'",

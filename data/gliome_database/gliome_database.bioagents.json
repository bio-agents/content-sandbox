                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.Glial cells are phenotypically heterogeneous non-neuronal components of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These cells are endowed with diverse functions and molecular machineries to detect and regulate neuronal or their own activities by various secreted mediators, such as proteinaceous factors. In particular, glia-secreted proteins form a basis of a complex network of glia-neuron or glia-glia interactions in health and diseases. In recent years, the analysis and profiling of glial secretomes have raised new expectations for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders due to the vital role of glia in numerous physiological or pathological processes of the nervous system. However, there is no online database of glia-secreted proteins available to facilitate glial research. Here, we developed a user-friendly 'Gliome' database (available at www.gliome.org), a web-based agent to access and analyze glia-secreted proteins. The database provides a vast collection of information on 3293 proteins that are released from glia of multiple species and have been reported to have differential functions under diverse experimental conditions. It contains a web-based interface with the following four key features regarding glia-secreted proteins: (i) fundamental information, such as signal peptide, SecretomeP value, functions and Gene Ontology category; (ii) differential expression patterns under distinct experimental conditions; (iii) disease association; and (iv) interacting proteins. In conclusion, the Gliome database is a comprehensive web-based agent to access and analyze glia-secretome data obtained from diverse experimental settings, whereby it may facilitate the integration of bioinformatics into glial research.",

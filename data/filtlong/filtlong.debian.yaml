  description: quality filtering agent for long reads of genome sequences
  long_description: " Filtlong is a agent for filtering long reads by quality. It can\
    \ take a\n set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both\n\
    \ read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when\n choosing\
    \ which reads pass the filter.\n"

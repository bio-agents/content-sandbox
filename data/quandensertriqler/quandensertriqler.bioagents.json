Published by American Chemical Society.Error estimation for differential protein quantification by label-free shotgun proteomics is challenging due to the multitude of error sources, each contributing uncertainty to the final results. We have previously designed a Bayesian model, Triqler, to combine such error terms into one combined quantification error. Here we present an interface for Triqler that takes MaxQuant results as input, allowing quick reanalysis of already processed data. We demonstrate that Triqler outperforms the original processing for a large set of both engineered and clinical/biological relevant data sets. Triqler and its interface to MaxQuant are available as a Python module under an Apache 2.0 license from https://pypi.org/project/triqler/.",

                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).In shotgun proteomics, the analysis of label-free quantification experiments is typically limited by the identification rate and the noise level in the quantitative data. This generally causes a low sensitivity in differential expression analysis. Here, we propose a quantification-first approach for peptides that reverses the classical identification-first workflow, thereby preventing valuable information from being discarded in the identification stage. Specifically, we introduce a method, Quandenser, that applies unsupervised clustering on both MS1 and MS2 level to summarize all analytes of interest without assigning identities. This reduces search time due to the data reduction. We can now employ open modification and de novo searches to identify analytes of interest that would have gone unnoticed in traditional pipelines. Quandenser+Triqler outperforms the state-of-the-art method MaxQuant+Perseus, consistently reporting more differentially abundant proteins for all tested datasets.

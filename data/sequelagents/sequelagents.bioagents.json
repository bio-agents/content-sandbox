                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: PacBio sequencing is an incredibly valuable third-generation DNA sequencing method due to very long read lengths, ability to detect methylated bases, and its real-time sequencing methodology. Yet, hitherto no agent was available for analyzing the quality of, subsampling, and filtering PacBio data. Results: Here we present SequelAgents, a command-line program containing three agents: Quality Control, Read Subsampling, and Read Filtering. The Quality Control agent quickly processes PacBio Sequel raw sequence data from multiple SMRTcells producing multiple statistics and publication-quality plots describing the quality of the data including N50, read length and count statistics, PSR, and ZOR. The Read Subsampling agent allows the user to subsample reads by one or more of the following criteria: longest subreads per CLR or random CLR selection. The Read Filtering agent provides options for normalizing data by filtering out certain low-quality scraps reads and/or by minimum CLR length. SequelAgents is implemented in bash, R, and Python using only standard libraries and packages and is platform independent. Conclusions: SequelAgents is a program that provides the only free, fast, and easy-to-use quality control agent, and the only program providing this kind of read subsampling and read filtering for PacBio Sequel raw sequence data, and is available at https://github.com/ISUgenomics/SequelAgents.",

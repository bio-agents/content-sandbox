description: Miscellaneous functions for classification and visualization, e.g. regularized
  discriminant analysis, sknn() kernel-density naive Bayes, an interface to svmlight
  and stepclass() wrapper variable selection for supervised classification, partimat()
  visualization of classification rules and shardsplot() of cluster results as well
  as kmodes() clustering for categorical data, corclust() variable clustering, variable
  extraction from different variable clustering models and weight of evidence preprocessing.

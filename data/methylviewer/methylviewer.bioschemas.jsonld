  "sc:description": "This agent was developed from CpGviewer such that the program can now analyse up to four different methylation sites such as CpG, GpC, CpNpG or any four user defined sites. If a non-native DNA methylase is used to modify chromatin-bound DNA, the methylation pattern can be used to identify the binding sites of DNA-binding proteins.",

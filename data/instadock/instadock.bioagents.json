For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Exploring protein-ligand interactions is a subject of immense interest, as it provides deeper insights into molecular recognition, mechanism of interaction and subsequent functions. Predicting an accurate model for a protein-ligand interaction is a challenging task. Molecular docking is a computational method used for predicting the preferred orientation, binding conformations and the binding affinity of a ligand to a macromolecular target, especially protein. It has been applied in 'virtual high-throughput screening' of chemical libraries containing millions of compounds to find potential leads in drug design and discovery. Here, we have developed InstaDock, a free and open access Graphical User Interface (GUI) program that performs molecular docking and high-throughput virtual screening efficiently. InstaDock is a single-click GUI that uses QuickVina-W, a modified version of AutoDock Vina for docking calculations, made especially for the convenience of non-bioinformaticians and for people who are not experts in using computers. InstaDock facilitates onboard analysis of docking and visual results in just a single click. To sum up, InstaDock is the easiest and more interactive interface than ever existing GUIs for molecular docking and high-throughput virtual screening. InstaDock is freely available for academic and industrial research purposes via https://hassanlab.org/instadock.",

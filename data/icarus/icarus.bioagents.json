With advances in both sequencing and computational technologies, it has become a new bottleneck in genomics studies. Indeed, evaluation of de novo genome assemblies is one of the areas that can benefit from the visualization. However, even though multiple quality assessment methods are now available, existing visualization agents are hardly suitable for this purpose. Here, we present Icarus - a novel genome visualizer for accurate assessment and analysis of genomic draft assemblies, which is based on the agent QUAST. Icarus can be used in studies where a related reference genome is available, as well as for non-model organisms. The agent is available online and as a standalone application.",

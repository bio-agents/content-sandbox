  "sc:description": "RazerS 3 is a agent for mapping millions of short genomic reads onto a\nreference genome. It was designed with focus on mapping next-generation\nsequencing reads onto whole DNA genomes. RazerS 3 searches for matches of\nreads with a percent identity above a given threshold (-i X), whereby it\ndetects alignments with mismatches as well as gaps.",

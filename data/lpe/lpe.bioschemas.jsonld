It uses resampling based FDR adjustment, and gives less conservative results than traditional 'BH' or 'BY' procedures. Data accepted is raw data in txt format from MAS4, MAS5 or dChip. Data can also be supplied after normalization. It is primarily used for analyzing data between two conditions. To use it for paired data, see library. For using it in multiple conditions, use HEM library.",

Rtips comprises two computational agents based on integer programming, IPknot for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots and RactIP for predicting RNA-RNA interactions with kissing hairpins. Both servers can run much faster than existing services with the same purpose on large data sets as well as being at least comparable in prediction accuracy. The Rtips web server along with the stand-alone programs is freely accessible at http://rna.naist.jp/. Â© 2012 The Author(s).",

description: Fitting possibly high dimensional penalized regression models. The penalty
  structure can be any combination of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2
  penalty (ridge) and a positivity constraint on the regression coefficients. The
  supported regression models are linear, logistic and Poisson regression and the
  Cox Proportional Hazards model. Cross-validation routines allow optimization of
  the tuning parameters.

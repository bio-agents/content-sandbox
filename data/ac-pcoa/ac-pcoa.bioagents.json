This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data. In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.",

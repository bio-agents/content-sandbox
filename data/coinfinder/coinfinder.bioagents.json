    "description": "Detecting Significant Associations and Dissociations in Pangenomes.\n\nA agent for the identification of coincident (associating and dissociating) genes in pangenomes.\n\ninput/output files associated with the analysis performed in the manuscript describing coinfinder.\n\nCoinfinder is an algorithm and software agent that detects genes which associate and dissociate with other genes more often than expected by chance in pangenomes. Coinfinder is written primarily in C++ and is a command line agent which generates text, gexf, and pdf outputs for the user.\n\nWritten in collaboration with Martin Rusilowicz",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Authors.The accessory genes of prokaryote and eukaryote pangenomes accumulate by horizontal gene transfer, differential gene loss, and the effects of selection and drift. We have developed Coinfinder, a software program that assesses whether sets of homolo-gous genes (gene families) in pangenomes associate or dissociate with each other (i.e. are ‘coincident’) more often than would be expected by chance. Coinfinder employs a user-supplied phylogenetic tree in order to assess the lineage-dependence (i.e. the phylogenetic distribution) of each accessory gene, allowing Coinfinder to focus on coincident gene pairs whose joint presence is not simply because they happened to appear in the same clade, but rather that they tend to appear together more often than expected across the phylogeny. Coinfinder is implemented in C++, Python3 and R and is freely available under the GNU license from https://​github.​com/​fwhelan/​coinfinder.",

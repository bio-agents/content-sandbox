      "sc:description": "A multifunctional R package for identification of tumor-specific neoantigens.\n\nIt is known that some mutant peptides, such as those resulting from missense mutations and frameshift insertions, can bind to the major histocompatibility complex and be presented to antitumor T cells on the surface of a tumor cell. These peptides are termed neoantigen, and it is important to understand this process for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we introduce an R package termed Neoantimon that can predict a list of potential neoantigens from a variety of mutations, which include not only somatic point mutations but insertions, deletions and structural variants",

In this paper, the applicability of the methodology in the field of life sciences is introduced through the analysis of the neural network of Caenorhabditis elegans. Simultaneously, an Octave and MATLAB-compatible NOCAD agentbox is proposed that provides a set of methods to automatically generate the relevant structural controllability and observability associated measures for linear or linearised systems and compare the different sensor placement methods.",

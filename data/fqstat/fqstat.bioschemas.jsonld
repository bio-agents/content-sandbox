      "sc:description": "A parallel architecture for very high-speed assessment of sequencing quality metrics | BACKGROUND:High throughput DNA RNA sequencing has revolutionized biological and clinical research. Sequencing is widely used, and generates very large amounts of data, mainly due to reduced cost and advanced technologies. Quickly assessing the quality of giga-to-tera base levels of sequencing data has become a routine but important task. Identification and elimination of low-quality sequence data is crucial for reliability of downstream analysis results. There is a need for a high-speed agent that uses optimized parallel programming for batch processing and simply gauges the quality of sequencing data from multiple datasets independent of any other processing steps. RESULTS:FQStat is a stand-alone, platform-independent software agent that assesses the quality of FASTQ files using parallel programming",

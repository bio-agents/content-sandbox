                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with human diseases. Although lncRNA-disease associations have received significant attention, no online repository is available to collect lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, key downstream targets, and important biological functions driven by disease-related lncRNAs in human diseases. We thus developed LncTarD (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/LncTarD/or http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LncTarD), a manually-curated database that provides a comprehensive resource of key lncRNA-target regulations, lncRNA-influenced functions, and lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in human diseases. LncTarD offers (i) 2822 key lncRNA-target regulations involving 475 lncRNAs and 1039 targets associated with 177 human diseases; (ii) 1613 experimentally-supported functional regulations and 1209 expression associations in human diseases; (iii) important biological functions driven by disease-related lncRNAs in human diseases; (iv) lncRNA-target regulations responsible for drug resistance or sensitivity in human diseases and (v) lncRNA microarray, lncRNA sequence data and transcriptome data of an 11 373 pan-cancer patient cohort from TCGA to help characterize the functional dynamics of these lncRNA-target regulations. LncTarD also provides a user-friendly interface to conveniently browse, search, and download data. LncTarD will be a useful resource platform for the further understanding of functions and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA deregulation in human disease, which will help to identify novel and sensitive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

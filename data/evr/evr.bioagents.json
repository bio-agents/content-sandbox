    "description": "EVR is a chromosome 3D structure reconstruction agent using an Error-Vector Resultant algorithm based on DNA interaction data. With normalized or unnormalized IF matrix as input, the program generate a chromosome 3D structure output in a .pdb file. Using Cython and OpenCL, the program can run on CPUs/GPUS/APUs and thus usually faster than similar agents.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Background: More and more 3C/Hi-C experiments on prokaryotes have been published. However, most of the published modeling agents for chromosome 3D structures are targeting at eukaryotes. How to transform prokaryotic experimental chromosome interaction data into spatial structure models is an important task and in great need. Results: We have developed a new reconstruction program for bacterial chromosome 3D structure models called EVR that exploits a simple Error-Vector Resultant (EVR) algorithm. This software agent is particularly optimized for the closed-loop structural features of prokaryotic chromosomes. The parallel implementation of the program can utilize the computing power of both multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Conclusions: EVR can be used to reconstruct the bacterial 3D chromosome structure based on the contact frequency matrix derived from 3C/Hi-C experimental data quickly and precisely.",

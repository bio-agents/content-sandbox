Leveraging on the user-friendliness of the Colab interface, LSTrAP-Cloud allows users to analyse large scale transcriptome data without having to access the linux terminal, making it accessible to both bioinformaticians and biologist. To get started, we have provided a tutorial based on example data found here. While the pipeline was designed for plants, we have also made the script compatible with non-plant organisms.",

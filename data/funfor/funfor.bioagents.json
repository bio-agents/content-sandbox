                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).The rapid advancement of functional data in various application fields has increased the demand for advanced statistical approaches that can incorporate complex structures and nonlinear associations. In this article, we propose a novel functional random forests (FunFor) approach to model the functional data response that is densely and regularly measured, as an extension of the landmark work of Breiman, who introduced traditional random forests for a univariate response. The FunFor approach is able to predict curve responses for new observations and selects important variables from a large set of scalar predictors. The FunFor approach inherits the efficiency of the traditional random forest approach in detecting complex relationships, including nonlinear and high-order interactions. Additionally, it is a non-parametric approach without the imposition of parametric and distributional assumptions. Eight simulation settings and one real-data analysis consistently demonstrate the excellent performance of the FunFor approach in various scenarios. In particular, FunFor successfully ranks the true predictors as the most important variables, while achieving the most robust variable sections and the smallest prediction errors when comparing it with three other relevant approaches. Although motivated by a biological leaf shape data analysis, the proposed FunFor approach has great potential to be widely applied in various fields due to its minimal requirement on tuning parameters and its distribution-free and model-free nature. An R package named ’FunFor’, implementing the FunFor approach, is available at GitHub.",

description: Kernel-based methods are powerful methods for integrating  heterogeneous
  types of data. mixKernel aims at providing methods to combine kernel for unsupervised
  exploratory analysis. Different solutions are  provided to compute a meta-kernel,
  in a consensus way or in a way that  best preserves the original topology of the
  data. mixKernel also integrates kernel PCA to visualize similarities between samples
  in a non linear space and from the multiple source point of view. Functions to assess
  and display important variables are also provided in the package. Jerome Mariette
  and  Nathalie Villa-Vialaneix (2017) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx682>.

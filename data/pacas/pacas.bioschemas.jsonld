      "sc:description": "PACAS is a agent for pairwise comparisons of aligned subsequences.\n\nPACAS consists of three files: Pacas.py, Pacas_FB.pl, and Pacas_CP.pl. In the current version, these all need to present in the same directory as the data files. The input files consist of a fasta file that contains the accession numbers for protein sequences, and the sequences themselves. The sequences need to be properly aligned, on a single line, and of equal length. It also requires an *.out file identically named to the *.fasta file, which indicates the low complexity regions of interest. These can be created as the output of programs such as seg, or manually.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2016 The Author(s).Similar to the development of gene set enrichment and gene regulatory network analysis agents over a decade ago, microRNA enrichment agents are currently gaining importance. Building on our experience with the gene set analysis agentkit GeneTrail, we implemented the miRNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation agent (miEAA). MiEAA is a web-based application that offers a variety of commonly applied statistical tests such as over-representation analysis and miRNA set enrichment analysis, which is similar to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Besides the different statistical tests, miEAA also provides rich functionality in terms of miRNA categories. Altogether, over 14 000 miRNA sets have been added, including pathways, diseases, organs and target genes. Importantly, our agent can be applied for miRNA precursors as well as mature miRNAs. To make the agent as useful as possible we additionally implemented supporting agents such as converters between different miRBase versions and converters from miRNA names to precursor names. We evaluated the performance of miEAA on two sets of miRNAs that are affected in lung adenocarcinomas and have been detected by array analysis.",

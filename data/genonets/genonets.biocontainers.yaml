description: 'A genotype network is a graph in which vertices represent genotypes
  that have the same phenotype. this agent provides the following features: (i) the
  construction of genotype networks for categorical and univariate phenotypes; (ii)
  analyses of genotype network topology and how it relates to robustness and evolvability,
  as well as analyses of genotype network topography and how it relates to the navigability
  of a genotype network; (iii) multiple interactive visualizations.'

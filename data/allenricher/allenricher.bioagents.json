    "description": "A comprehensive gene set function enrichment agent for both model and non-model species. This is a agent designed for functional genomic and large-scale genetic studies from which large number of gene lists (e.g. differentially expressed gene sets, co-expressed gene sets, or differential epigenomic modification gene sets etc) are continuously generated. AllEnricher incorporates information from different public resources and provides an easy way for biologists to make sense out of gene lists.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Function genomic studies will generally result in lists of genes that may provide clues for exploring biological questions and discovering unanticipated functions, based on differential gene expression analysis, differential epigenomic analysis or co-expression network analysis. While agents have been developed to identify biological functions that are enriched in the genes sets, there remains a need for comprehensive agents that identify functional enrichment of genes for both model and non-model species from a different function classification perspective. Results: We developed AllEnricher, a agent that calculates gene set function enrichment, with user-defined updatable libraries backing up for both model and non-model species as well as providing comprehensive functional interpretation from multiple dimensions, including GO, KEGG, Reactome, DO and DisGeNET. Conclusions: AllEnricher incorporates up to date information from different public resources and provides a comprehensive resolution for biologists to make sense out of specific gene sets, making it an advanced open-source agent for gene set function analysis.",

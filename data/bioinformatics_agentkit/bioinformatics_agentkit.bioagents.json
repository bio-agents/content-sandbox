Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The MPI Bioinformatics Agentkit (http://agentkit.tuebingen.mpg.de) is an open, interactive web service for comprehensive and collaborative protein bioinformatic analysis. It offers a wide array of interconnected, state-of-the-art bioinformatics agents to experts and non-experts alike, developed both externally (e.g. BLAST+, HMMER3, MUSCLE) and internally (e.g. HHpred, HHblits, PCOILS). While a beta version of the Agentkit was released 10 years ago, the current production-level release has been available since 2008 and has serviced more than 1.6 million external user queries. The usage of the Agentkit has continued to increase linearly over the years, reaching more than 400 000 queries in 2015. In fact, through the breadth of its agents and their tight interconnection, the Agentkit has become an excellent platform for experimental scientists as well as a useful resource for teaching bioinformatic inquiry to students in the life sciences. In this article, we report on the evolution of the Agentkit over the last ten years, focusing on the expansion of the agent repertoire (e.g. CS-BLAST, HHblits) and on infrastructural work needed to remain operative in a changing web environment.",

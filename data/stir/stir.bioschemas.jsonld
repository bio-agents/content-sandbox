      "sc:description": "PET image reconstruction using physical and mathematical modelling for time of flight PET-MR scanners in the STIR library.\n\nThis work demonstrates how computational and physical modelling of the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition process for a state-of-the-art integrated PET and magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MR) system can produce images comparable to the manufacturer. The GE SIGNA PET MR scanner is manufactured by General Electric and has time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities of about 390 ps. All software development took place in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http: stir.sf.net) library, which is a widely used open source software to reconstruct data as exported from emission tomography scanners. The new software developments will be integrated into STIR, providing the opportunity for researchers worldwide to establish and expand their image reconstruction methods",

description: To conduct Bayesian inference regression for responses with multilevel
  explanatory variables and missing values; It uses function from Stan, a software
  to implement posterior sampling using Hamiltonian MC and its variation Non-U-Turn
  algorithms. It implements the posterior sampling of regression coefficients from
  the multilevel regression models. The package has two main functions to handle not-missing-at-random
  missing responses and left-censored with not-missing-at random responses. The purpose
  is to provide a similar format as the other R regression functions but using Stan
  models.

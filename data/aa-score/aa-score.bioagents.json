                "abstract": "Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.The protein-ligand scoring function plays an important role in computer-aided drug discovery and is heavily used in virtual screening and lead optimization. In this study, we developed a new empirical protein-ligand scoring function with amino acid-specific interaction components for hydrogen bond, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions. In addition, hydrophobic, -stacking, cation, and metal-ligand interactions are also included in the new scoring function. To better evaluate the performance of the AA-Score, we generated several new test sets for evaluation of scoring, ranking, and docking performances, respectively. Extensive tests show that AA-Score performs well on scoring, docking, and ranking as compared to other widely used traditional scoring functions. The performance improvement of AA-Score benefits from the decomposition of individual interaction into amino acid-specific types. To facilitate applications, we developed an easy-to-use agent to analyze protein-ligand interaction fingerprint and predict binding affinity using the AA-Score.

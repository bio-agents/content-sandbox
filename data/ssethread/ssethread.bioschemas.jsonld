      "sc:description": "SSEThread  is an Integrative threading of the DNA-PKcs sequence based on data from chemical cross-linking and hydrogen deuterium exchange.\n\nX-ray crystallography and electron microscopy maps resolved to 3-8 Ã… are generally sufficient for tracing the path of the polypeptide chain in space, while often insufficient for unambiguously registering the sequence on the path (i.e., threading). Frequently, however, additional information is available from other biophysical experiments, physical principles, statistical analyses, and other prior models. Here, we formulate an integrative approach for sequence assignment to a partial backbone model as an optimization problem, which requires three main components: the representation of the system, the scoring function, and the optimization method.",

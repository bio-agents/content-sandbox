If you upload an empirical pre-determination of subtypes for samples by experts or clinicians based on clinical phenotypes, images or experience, CEPICS will take it as gold standard to compare. If you donâ€™t have any subtype information, CEPICS will calculate NMI and ARI between the results of every two methods for each k, and then calculated the average NMI and ARI for each method at each k",

    "description": "A Comparison and Evaluation Platform for Integration Methods in Cancer Subtyping.\n\nThere are two comparison strategies for the NMI and ARI depending on the availability of true labels of patients. If you upload an empirical pre-determination of subtypes for samples by experts or clinicians based on clinical phenotypes, images or experience, CEPICS will take it as gold standard to compare. If you don’t have any subtype information, CEPICS will calculate NMI and ARI between the results of every two methods for each k, and then calculated the average NMI and ARI for each method at each k",

Multi-omics molecular data can characterize cancers at different levels. Up to now, many computational methods that integrate multi-omics data for cancer subtyping have been proposed. However, there are no consistent criteria to evaluate the integration methods due to the lack of gold standards (e.g., the number of subtypes in a specific cancer). Since comprehensive evaluation and comparison between different methods serves as a useful agent or guideline for users to select an optimal method for their own purpose, we develop a scalable platform, CEPICS, for comprehensively evaluating and comparing multi-omics data integration methods in cancer subtyping. Given a user-specified maximum number of subtypes, k-max, CEPICS provides (1) cancer subtyping results using up to five built-in state-of-the-art integration methods under the number of subtypes from two to k-max, (2) a report including the evaluation of each user-selected method and comparisons across them using clustering performance metrics and clinical survival analysis, and (3) an overall analysis of subtyping results by different methods representing a robust cancer subtype prediction for samples. Furthermore, users can upload subtyping results of their own methods to compare with the built-in methods. CEPICS is implemented as an R package and is freely available at https://github.com/GaoLabXDU/CEPICS.",

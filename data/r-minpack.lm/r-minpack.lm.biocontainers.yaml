description: 'The nls.lm function provides an R interface to lmder and lmdif from
  the MINPACK library, for solving nonlinear least-squares problems by a modification
  of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, with support for lower and upper parameter
  bounds.  The implementation can be used via nls-like calls using the nlsLM function.  '

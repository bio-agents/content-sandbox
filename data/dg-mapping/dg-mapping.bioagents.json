                "abstract": "Â© 2022, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.In this work, we present the release of a novel easy to use software package called DGM or Directed-Graph-Mapping. DGM can automatically analyze any type of arrhythmia to find reentry or focal sources if the measurements are synchronized in time. Currently, DGM requires the local activation times (LAT) and the spatial coordinates of the measured electrodes. However, there is no requirement for any spatial organization of the electrodes, allowing to analyze clinical, experimental or computational data. DGM creates directed networks of the activation, which are analyzed with fast algorithms to search for reentry (cycles in the network) and focal sources (nodes with outgoing arrows). DGM has been mainly optimized to analyze atrial tachycardia, but we also discuss other applications of DGM demonstrating its wide applicability. The goal is to release a free software package which can allow researchers to save time in the analysis of cardiac data. An academic license is attached to the software, allowing only non-commercial use of the software. All updates of the software, user and installation guide will be published on a dedicated website www.dgmapping.com. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",

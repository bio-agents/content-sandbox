      "sc:description": "A protein backbone torsion angles and secondary structure predictor based on ensemble neural networks.\n\nPredictions of protein backbone torsion angles (ϕ and ψ) and secondary structure from sequence are crucial subproblems in protein structure prediction. With the development of deep learning approaches, their accuracies have been significantly improved. To capture the long-range interactions, most of studies integrate bidirectional recurrent neural networks into their models.",

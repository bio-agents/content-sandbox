This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Knowledge bases are largely developed and utilized in academic and industrial fields, such as DBPedia, VIAF, LoC, Getty, and which are published in the Linked Data format. However, if you want to view different resources on these knowledge bases, you have to switch between different web pages from these resources. Therefore, we proposed a decentralized data hub named SinoPedia, which consists of several linked data services and can re-publish these RDF data in one platform. Firstly, these different Linked Data services include: Linked Data Transformation Service (LDTS), Linked Data Query Service (LDQS), Linked Data Publishing Service (LDPS) and Linked Data Knowledge Service (LDKS). The resource URI is the basis and core of the linked data, thus we will focus on the resource forwarding mechanism in LDPS service which can rewrite resource URI using a global and standard format among knowledge bases. Some knowledge bases were configured in SinoPedia platform in this paper. In addition to the above services, Linked Data Reasoning Service (LDRS) and Linked Data Intelligence Service (LDIS) will be added to the platform in the future. In short, all of these Linked Data Services will form the core framework in order to providing a good linked data application ecosystem.",

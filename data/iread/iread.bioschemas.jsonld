      "sc:description": "A agent for intron retention detection from RNA-seq data.\n\niREAD (intron REtention Analysis and Detector)is a agent to detect intron retention(IR) events from RNA-seq datasets. Independent introns, referring to those introns that do not overlap with any exons of any splice isoforms, are used for detecting IRs. iREAD takes two input files: (1) a BAM file representing transcritome, and a bed-like text file containing independent intron coordinates, and output intron retention events based on a set of criteria that filter for reliable IR events. These criteria involves the number of reads/fragments in intronic regions, FPKM, junction reads, read distribution patterns within an intron.",

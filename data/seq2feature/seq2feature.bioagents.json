All rights reserved.Motivation:Machine learning techniques require various descriptors from protein and nucleic acid sequences to understand/predict their structure and function as well as distinguishing between disease and neutral mutations. Hence, availability of a feature extraction agent is necessary to bridge the gap. Results: We developed a comprehensive web-based agent, Seq2Feature, which computes 252 protein and 41 DNA sequence-based descriptors. These features include physicochemical, energetic and conformational properties of proteins, mutation matrices and contact potentials as well as nucleotide composition, physicochemical and conformational properties of DNA. We propose that Seq2Feature could serve as an effective agent for extracting protein and DNA sequence-based features as applicable inputs to machine learning algorithms.",

      "sc:description": "Creating and sharing reproducible research code the workflowr way.\n\nOrganize your project into a research website.\n\nworkflowr: organized + reproducible + shareable data science in R.\n\nThe workflowr R package helps researchers organize their analyses in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results. Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results. Any R user can quickly and easily adopt workflowr.\n\nA Framework for Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science.\n\nProvides a workflow for your analysis projects by combining literate programming ('knitr' and 'rmarkdown') and version control ('Git', via 'git2r') to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results",

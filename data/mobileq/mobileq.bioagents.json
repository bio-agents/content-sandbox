Experience sampling has several strengths and is becoming more widely conducted, but there are few free software options. To address this gap, mobileQ has freely available servers, a web interface, and an Android app. To reduce the barrier to entry, it requires no high-level programming and uses an easy, point-and-click interface. It is designed to be used on dedicated research phones, allowing for experimenter control and eliminating selection bias. In this article, we introduce setting up a study in mobileQ, outline the set of help resources available for new users, and highlight the success with which mobileQ has been used in our lab.",

    "description": "Standalone application for Gene Ontology and Human Phenotype Ontology term enrichment analysis.\nDiNGO is a standalone application based on open source code from BiNGO a Java based agent aimed to determine which Gene Ontology (GO) categories are overrepresented in a set of genes. DiNGO is a command line application which is able to do GO and HPO term enrichment on a set of genes or proteins. DiNGO is multithreaded application which offers fast processing of large datasets. In addition, the application offers gene/protein identifiers conversion agent as well as automatic download of HPO and GO annotation resources.",

All rights reserved.Although various agents for Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis are available, there is still room for improvement. Hence, we present DiNGO, a standalone application based on an open source code from BiNGO, a widely-used application to assess the overrepresentation of GO categories. Besides facilitating GO term enrichment analyses, DiNGO has been developed to allow for convenient Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term overrepresentation investigation. This is an important contribution considering the increasing interest in HPO in scientific research and its potential in clinical settings. DiNGO supports gene/protein identifier conversion and an automatic updating of GO and HPO annotation resources. Finally, DiNGO can rapidly process a large amount of data due to its multithread design.",

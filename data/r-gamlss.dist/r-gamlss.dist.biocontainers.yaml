description: A set of distributions which can be used for modelling the response variables
  in Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape, Rigby and Stasinopoulos
  (2005), <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x>. The distributions can be continuous,
  discrete or mixed distributions. Extra distributions can be created, by transforming,
  any continuous distribution defined on the real line, to a distribution defined
  on ranges 0 to infinity or 0 to 1, by using a log or a logit transformation respectively.

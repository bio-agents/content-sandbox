      "sc:description": "An R-package that estimates a climate-driven mosquito-borne viral suitability index.\n\nEstimator of climate-driven, mosquito-borne viral suitability index.\n\nUnderstanding how climate dictates the timing and potential of mosquito-borne viral transmission is essential for preparedness of public health systems and design of control strategies. We developed the Mosquito-borne Viral Suitability Estimator (MVSE) software package for the R programming environment. The package estimates a suitability index based on a climate-driven mathematical expression for the basic reproductive number (R0) of a well established mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses. By accounting for local humidity and temperature, as well as viral, vector and human priors, suitability can be estimated for specific and viral species, as well as different regions of the globe.",

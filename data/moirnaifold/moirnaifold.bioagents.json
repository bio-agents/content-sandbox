                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The Author(s) 2021.Novel agents for in silico design of RNA constructs such as riboregulators are required in order to reduce time and cost to production for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic advances. Here, we present MoiRNAiFold, a versatile and user-friendly agent for de novo synthetic RNA design. MoiRNAiFold is based on Constraint Programming and it includes novel variable types, heuristics and restart strategies for Large Neighborhood Search. Moreover, this software can handle dozens of design constraints and quality measures and improves features for RNA regulation control of gene expression, such as Translation Efficiency calculation. We demonstrate that MoiRNAiFold outperforms any previous software in benchmarking structural RNA puzzles from EteRNA. Importantly, with regard to biologically relevant RNA designs, we focus on RNA riboregulators, demonstrating that the designed RNA sequences are functional both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we have generated a powerful agent for de novo complex RNA design that we make freely available as a web server (https://moiraibiodesign.com/design/).",

description: A collection of algorithms and functions to aid statistical modeling.
  Includes growth curve comparisons, limiting dilution analysis (aka ELDA), mixed
  linear models, heteroscedastic regression, inverse-Gaussian probability calculations,
  Gauss quadrature and a secure convergence algorithm for nonlinear models. Includes
  advanced generalized linear model functions that implement secure convergence, dispersion
  modeling and Tweedie power-law families.

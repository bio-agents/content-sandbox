Enter a mutation or list of mutations (one per line) into the form below using the format chromosome,position,reference,mutant (see Help for more details). Mutations uploaded from a file should use the VCF format with a minimum of five columns (chromosome, position, id, reference, mutant).",

Tested on somatic mutations, CScape tends to outperform alternative methods, reaching 91% balanced accuracy in coding regions and 70% in non-coding regions, while even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions. Positive predictions tend to cluster in genomic regions, so we apply a statistical approach to isolate coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome that appear enriched for high-confidence predicted disease-drivers.",

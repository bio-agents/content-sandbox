Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.An updated Lnc2Cancer 3.0 (http://www.bio-bigdata.net/lnc2cancer or http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/lnc2cancer) database, which includes comprehensive data on experimentally supported long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) associated with human cancers. In addition, web agents for analyzing lncRNA expression by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) are described. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 was updated with several new features, including (i) Increased cancer-associated lncRNA entries over the previous version. The current release includes 9254 lncRNA-cancer associations, with 2659 lncRNAs and 216 cancer subtypes. (ii) Newly adding 1049 experimentally supported circRNA-cancer associations, with 743 circRNAs and 70 cancer subtypes. (iii) Experimentally supported regulatory mechanisms of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs, involving microRNAs, transcription factors (TF), genetic variants, methylation and enhancers were included. (iv) Appending experimentally supported biological functions of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs including cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), immunity and coding ability. (v) Experimentally supported clinical relevance of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs in metastasis, recurrence, circulation, drug resistance, and prognosis was included. Additionally, two flexible online agents, including RNA-seq and scRNA-seq web agents, were developed to enable fast and customizable analysis and visualization of lncRNAs in cancers. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 is a valuable resource for elucidating the associations between lncRNA, circRNA and cancer.",

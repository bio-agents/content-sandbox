description: Package for analyzing splice events from rna-seq data. input data are
  sequence reads mapped to a reference genome in bam format. genes are represented
  as a genome-wide splice graph, which can be obtained from existing annotation or
  can be predicted from the data. splice events are identified from the graph and
  are quantified locally using structurally compatible reads at the start or end of
  each splice variant.

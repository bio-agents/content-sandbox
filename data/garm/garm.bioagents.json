    "description": "GARM (Genome Assembler, Reconcilation and Merging) is a new software pipeline to merge and reconcile assemblies from different algorithms or sequencing technologies. It relies on the observation that a combination of sequencing methods will work better together to reconstruct a genome in its totality, overcoming the limitations of each technology and assembly method if they were used in isolation. The pipeline is based on perl scripts and third-party open source software like the AMOS package.",

Despite these improvements, genome assembly remains a challenge in genome sequencing projects, especially when different sequencing platforms are used. At the present, there is no program that can handle and assemble different sequencing technologies better than specialized software for each of them. Also, very few protocols are available for merging results from different algorithms, technologies or both. We present GARM, (Genome Assembler, Reconciliation and Merging) a pipeline to merge assemblies from different algorithms or sequencing technologies. Â© 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",

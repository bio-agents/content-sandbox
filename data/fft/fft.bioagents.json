    "description": "A agent for quantitatively characterizing the morphology and growth of filamentous fungi.\n\nThe FFT represents a user-friendly agent that automatically characterizes several fungal phenotypes using images that can be obtained using basic imaging devices. The FFT can be used to study different fungal species, conditions and image scales and resolutions. Relying on simple built-in image analysis functions, the FFT is able to quantitatively characterize conidiation, conidia morphology and different aspects of the mycelium, including the growth area, number of hyphal tips and total length of the hyphae. In addition, we developed a function within the FFT that can detect and count traps developed by nematode-trapping fungi.",

                "abstract": "Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and serve as important biological models in various scientific fields including genetics, cell biology, ecology, evolution, and chemistry. A significant obstacle in studying filamentous fungi is the lack of agents for characterizing their growth and morphology in an efficient and quantitative manner. Consequently, assessments of the growth of filamentous fungi are often subjective and imprecise. In order to remedy this problem, we developed Fungal Feature Tracker (FFT), a user-friendly software comprised of different image analysis agents to automatically quantify different fungal characteristics, such as spore number, spore morphology, and measurements of total length, number of hyphal tips and the area covered by the mycelium. In addition, FFT can recognize and quantify specialized structures such as the traps generated by nematode-trapping fungi, which could be tuned to quantify other distinctive fungal structures in different fungi. We present a detailed characterization and comparison of a few fungal species as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of our software. Using FFT, we were able to quantify various features at strain and species level, such as mycelial growth over time and the length and width of spores, which would be difficult to track using classical approaches. In summary, FFT is a powerful agent that enables quantitative measurements of fungal features and growth, allowing objective and precise characterization of fungal phenotypes.",

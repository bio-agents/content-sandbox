                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Intrinsically disordered proteins are frequently involved in important regulatory processes in the cell thanks to their ability to bind several different targets performing sometimes even opposite functions. The PentUnFOLD algorithm is a physicochemical method that is based on new propensity scales for disordered, nonstable and stable elements of secondary structure and on the counting of stabilizing and destabilizing intraprotein contacts. Unlike other methods, it works with a PDB file, and it can determine not only those fragments of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils that can turn into disordered state (the “dark” side of the disorder), but also nonstable regions of alpha helices and beta strands which are able to turn into random coils (the “light” side), and vice versa (H ↔ C, E ↔ C). The scales have been obtained from structural data on disordered regions from the middle parts of amino acid sequences only, and not on their expectedly disordered N- and C-termini. Among other tendencies we have found that regions of both alpha helices and beta strands that can turn into the disordered state are relatively enriched in residues of Ala, Met, Asp, and Lys, while regions of both alpha helices and beta strands that can turn into random coil are relatively enriched in hydrophilic residues, and Cys, Pro, and Gly. Moreover, PentUnFOLD has the option to determine the effect of secondary structure transitions on the stability of a given region of a protein.

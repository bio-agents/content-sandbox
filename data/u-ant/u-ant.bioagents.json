Yet, these healthcare data can only be released for secondary use if they have undergone anonymization. Results: We present and describe μ-ANT, a practical and easily configurable anonymization agent for (healthcare) data. It implements several state-of-the-art methods to offer robust privacy guarantees and preserve the utility of the anonymized data as much as possible. μ-ANT also supports the heterogenous attribute types commonly found in electronic healthcare records and targets both practitioners and software developers interested in data anonymization.",

Increasingly, these data are created with support from automated text mining. Text-mining agents have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. We describe 10 straightforward writing tips-and a web agent, PubReCheck-guiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining agents. We anticipate these guides will help authors' work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers.",

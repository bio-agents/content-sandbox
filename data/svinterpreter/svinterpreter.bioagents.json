Mainly due to incompleteness and the scattered nature of the available annotation data of the human genome, manual interpretation of the SV’s clinical significance is laborious and cumbersome. Since bioinformatic agents developed for this task are limited, a comprehensive agent to assist clinical outcome prediction of SVs is warranted. Herein, we present SVInterpreter, a free Web application, which analyzes both balanced and unbalanced SVs using topologically associated domains (TADs) as genome units. Among others, gene-associated data (as function and dosage sensitivity), phenotype similarity scores, and copy number variants (CNVs) scoring metrics are retrieved for an informed SV interpretation. For evaluation, we retrospectively applied SVInterpreter to 97 balanced (translocations and inversions) and 125 unbalanced (deletions, duplications, and insertions) previously published SVs, and 145 SVs identified from 20 clinical samples. Our results showed the ability of SVInterpreter to support the evaluation of SVs by (1) confirming more than half of the predictions of the original studies, (2) decreasing 40% of the variants of uncertain significance, and (3) indicating several potential position effect events. To our knowledge, SVInterpreter is the most comprehensive TAD-based agent to identify the possible disease-causing candidate genes and to assist prediction of the clinical outcome of SVs.

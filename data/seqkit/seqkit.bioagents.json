Existing agents only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems.

This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive agentkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar agents. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

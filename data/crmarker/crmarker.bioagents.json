However, as far as we know, there are still no searchable and predictable resources focusing on multiple classes of RNA molecular markers in cancers. Herein, we developed CRMarker, a manually curated comprehensive repository of cancer RNA markers. In the current release, CRMarker v1.1 consists of 5489 “known” cancer RNA markers based on 8756 valid publications in PubMed, including 2878 mRNAs (genes), 1314 miRNAs, 1097 lncRNAs and 200 circRNAs, and involving two functional molecules (diagnosis and prognosis), 21 organisms and 154 cancers. The search results provided by the database are comprehensive, including 11 items such as RNA molecule expression and risk level, type of tissue or sample, cancer subtype, reference type, etc. Moreover, CRMarker also provides more than 18,000 potential cancer RNA markers, which are predicted based on “guilt-by-association” analysis of the above-mentioned “known” RNA markers and three molecular interaction networks, and survival analysis of 18 gene expression data sets with survival data. CRMarker v1.1 has a friendly interface and is freely available online at http://crmarker.hnnu.edu.cn/. We aim to build a comprehensive platform that is convenient for cancer researchers and clinicians to inquire and retrieve.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Drug-target interactions (DTIs) play a crucial role in target-based drug discovery and development. Computational prediction of DTIs can effectively complement experimental wet-lab techniques for the identification of DTIs, which are typically time- A nd resource-consuming. However, the performances of the current DTI prediction approaches suffer from a problem of low precision and high false-positive rate. In this study, we aim to develop a novel DTI prediction method for improving the prediction performance based on a cascade deep forest (CDF) model, named DTI-CDF, with multiple similarity-based features between drugs and the similarity-based features between target proteins extracted from the heterogeneous graph, which contains known DTIs. In the experiments, we built five replicates of 10-fold cross-validation under three different experimental settings of data sets, namely, corresponding DTI values of certain drugs (SD), targets (ST), or drug-target pairs (SP) in the training sets are missed but existed in the test sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach DTI-CDF achieves a significantly higher performance than that of the traditional ensemble learning-based methods such as random forest and XGBoost, deep neural network, and the state-of-the-art methods such as DDR. Furthermore, there are 1352 newly predicted DTIs which are proved to be correct by KEGG and DrugBank databases.

description: Seacr is intended to call peaks and enriched regions from sparse cut&run
  or chromatin profiling data in which background is dominated by zeroes (i.e. regions
  with no read coverage). it requires r (https://www.r-project.org) and bedagents (https://bedagents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  to be available in your path, and it requires bedgraphs from paired-end sequencing
  as input, which can be generated from read pair bed files (i.e. bed coordinates
  reflecting the 5 and 3 termini of each read pair) using bedagents genomecov with
  the -bg flag, or alternatively from name-sorted paired-end bam files as described
  in preparing input bedgraph files below.

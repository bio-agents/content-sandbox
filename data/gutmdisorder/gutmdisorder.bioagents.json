Each entry in the gutMDisorder contains detailed information on an association, including an intestinal microbe, a disorder name, intervention measures, experimental technology and platform, characteristic of samples, web sites for downloading the sequencing data, a brief description of the association, a literature reference, and so on. gutMDisorder provides a user-friendly interface to browse, retrieve each entry using gut microbes, disorders, and intervention measures. It also offers pages for downloading all the entries and submitting new experimentally validated associations.",

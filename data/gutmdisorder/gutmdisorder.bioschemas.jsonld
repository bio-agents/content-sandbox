Alterations in the composition of the gut microbial community play crucial roles in the development of chronic disorders. And the beneficial effects of drugs, foods and other intervention measures on disorders could be microbially mediated. The current version of gutMDisorder documents 2263 curated associations between 579 gut microbes and 123 disorders or 77 intervention measures in Human, and 930 curated associations between 273 gut microbes and 33 disorders or 151 intervention measures in Mouse",

Many studies have shown that miRNAs are closely related to the occurrence, development and diagnosis of human diseases. Traditional biological experiments are costly and time consuming. As a result, effective computational models have become increasingly popular for predicting associations between miRNAs and diseases, which could effectively boost human disease diagnosis and prevention. RESULTS: We propose a novel computational framework, called AEMDA, to identify associations between miRNAs and diseases. AEMDA applies a learning-based method to extract dense and high-dimensional representations of diseases and miRNAs from integrated disease semantic similarity, miRNA functional similarity and heterogeneous related interaction data. In addition, AEMDA adopts a deep autoencoder that does not need negative samples to retrieve the underlying associations between miRNAs and diseases. Furthermore, the reconstruction error is used as a measurement to predict disease-associated miRNAs. Our experimental results indicate that AEMDA can effectively predict disease-related miRNAs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

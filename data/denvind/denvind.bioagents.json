For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Dengue virus (DENV) researchers often face challenges with the highly time-consuming process of collecting and curating information on known inhibitors during the standard drug discovery process. To this end, however, required collective information is not yet available on a single platform. Hence, we have developed the DenvInD database for experimentally validated DENV inhibitors against its known targets presently hosted at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/denvind/. This database provides comprehensive information, i.e. PubChem IDs, SMILES, IC50, EC50, CC50, and wherever available Ki values of the 484 compounds in vitro validated as inhibitors against respective drug targets of DENV. Also, the DenvInD database has been linked to the user-friendly web-based interface and accessibility features, such as simple search, advanced search and data browsing. All the required data curation was conducted manually from the reported scientific literature and PubChem. The collected information was then organized into the DenvInD database using sequence query language under user interface by hypertext markup language. DenvInD is the first useful repository of its kind which would augment the DENV drug discovery research by providing essential information on known DENV inhibitors for molecular docking, computational screening, pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling.",

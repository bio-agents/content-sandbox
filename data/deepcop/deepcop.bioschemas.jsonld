      "sc:description": "Deep Learning-Based Approach to Predict Gene Regulating Effects of Small Molecules | MOTIVATION:Recent advances in the areas of bioinformatics and chemogenomics are poised to accelerate the discovery of small-molecule regulators of cell development. Combining large genomics and molecular data sources with powerful deep learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize predictive biology. In this study, we present Deep Compound Profiler (DeepCOP), a deep learning based model that can predict gene regulating effects of low-molecular weight compounds. This model can be used for direct identification of a drug candidate causing a desired gene expression response, without utilizing any information on its interactions with protein target(s)",

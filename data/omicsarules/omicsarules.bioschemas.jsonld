      "sc:description": "A R package for integration of multi-omics datasets via association rules mining.\n\nagent for the analysis of multimodal high-throughput data.\n\nOmicsARules is a agent for the analysis of multi-omics high-throughput data based on the use of association rules mining. OmicsARules supports to identify recurrent and associated patterns, and provides a new dimension for exploring single or multiple omics data across sequencing platforms or across samples. Besides, a new rule-interestingness measure Lamda3 is embeded in OmicsARules, it can be used to evaluate the association rules and identify biologically significant patterns. Association rule mining and visualizing were implemented in R environment using package arules and ggplot2",

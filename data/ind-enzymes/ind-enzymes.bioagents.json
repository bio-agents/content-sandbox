                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.Biocatalysts provide many advantages over the traditional chemically assisted processes prevalent in industries. Consequently, the search for novel enzymes has increased over the years with a renewed interest in thermophilic and psychrophilic bacterial species. Enzymes or extremozymes extracted from such species have exhibited an affinity to extreme temperatures which is a prerequisite for many industrial applications. However, utilisation of these enzymes faces a major bottleneck. The distribution of sequence data associated with thermophiles and psychrophiles is overwhelming, spanning various databases and scientific literature. Based on more than 100 publications and genomes from over 300 thermophilic and psychrophilic bacterial species, we have constructed the database IND-Enzymes (indenzymes.srmist.edu.in). This database consists of over 20,120 nucleotide and protein sequences belonging to the hydrolytic enzyme class lipase, protease, esterase and amylase. Users can access over 100 published enzymes, 200 PDB structural data. Enzymes derived from genomes can be directly downloaded and users can also access the entire annotation data derived from species individually. Along with an alignment agent and python based pipelines, IND-Enzymes serves as the largest sequence repository for hydrolytic enzymes from thermophilic and psychrophilic bacterial species. This database showcases resources that are essential for protein engineering of hot–cold stable enzymes.",

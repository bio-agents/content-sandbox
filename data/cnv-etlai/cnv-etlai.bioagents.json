                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Elsevier LtdBackground: Although copy number variations (CNVs) are infrequent, each anomaly is unique, and multiple CNVs can appear simultaneously. Growing evidence suggests that CNVs contribute to a wide range of diseases. When CNVs are detected, assessment of their clinical significance requires a thorough literature review. This process can be extremely time-consuming and may delay disease diagnosis. Therefore, we have developed CNV Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Artificial Intelligence (CNV-ETLAI), an innovative agent that allows experts to classify and interpret CNVs accurately and efficiently. Methods: We combined text, table, and image processing algorithms to develop an artificial intelligence platform that automatically extracts, transforms, and organizes CNV information into a database. To validate CNV-ETLAI, we compared its performance to ground truth datasets labeled by a human expert. In addition, we analyzed the CNV data, which was collected using CNV-ETLAI via a crowdsourcing approach. Results: In comparison to a human expert, CNV-ETLAI improved CNV detection accuracy by 4% and performed the analysis 60 times faster. This performance can improve even further with upscaling of the CNV-ETLAI database as usage increases. 5,800 CNVs from 2,313 journal articles were collected. Total CNV frequency for the whole chromosome was highest for chromosome X, whereas CNV frequency per 1 Mb of genomic length was highest for chromosome 22. Conclusions: We have developed, tested, and shared CNV-ETLAI for research and clinical purposes (https://lmic.mgh.harvard.edu/CNV-ETLAI). Use of CNV-ETLAI is expected to ease and accelerate diagnostic classification and interpretation of CNVs.",

The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we introduce a agent, PyGTED to compute GTED. It implements the algorithm based on the polynomial time algorithm devised for it by the authors. Informally, the GTED is the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs.",

Understanding the biomolecular response mechanism of radiation is very important for the prevention and treatment of radiation diseases. However, function information of these radiation-associated genes is hidden in numbers of scientific papers and databases, making it difficult to understand the response mechanism of ionizing radiation. Materials and methods: We collected radiation-associated genes by literature and database mining. Literature and database mining was performed on the basis of biomedical literature from PubMed and gene expression datasets from GEO respectively. Results: We built an ionizing radiation related knowledgebase RadAtlas 1.0 (http://biokb.ncpsb.org/radatlas), which contains 598 radiation-associated genes compiled from literature mining, and 611 potential radiation-associated genes collected from gene expression datasets by differential gene expression analysis. We also provide a user-friendly web interface that offers multiple search methods. Conclusions: RadAtlas collected a large amount of information about genes, biological processes, and pathways related to ionizing radiation. It is the first attempt to provide a comprehensive catalog of radiation-associated genes with literature evidence and potential radiation-associated genes with differential expression evidence. We believe that RadAtlas would be a helpful agent to understand the response mechanism to ionizing radiation.",

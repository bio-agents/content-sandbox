The Acoustics Apps address the increasing demand for digitized teaching methods, which might be suitable for home schooling or as a complement to physical experiments by adding interactive simulation. The apps combine learning by experimenting, observing, and exploring using state-of-The-Art scientific methods and numerical simulations. The ability to visualize and control acoustic phenomena facilitates understanding of the relevant physical principles. The apps are designed to be used intuitively and can be tailored to suit the existing knowledge of the user. As such, a wide range of users can benefit from this learning aid. It has been developed to allow barrier-free access to modern educational agents, requiring only a device with a browser and Internet access. The necessary computing power is provided by an external server using the COMSOL ServerTM technology. The Acoustics Apps are freely available for academic and teaching purposes at apps.vib.mw.tum.de.",

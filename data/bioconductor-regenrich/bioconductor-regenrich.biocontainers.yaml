description: 'This package is a pipeline to identify the key gene regulators in a
  biological process, for example in cell differentiation and in cell development
  after stimulation. There are four major steps in this pipeline: (1) differential
  expression analysis; (2) regulator-target network inference; (3) enrichment analysis;
  and (4) regulators scoring and ranking.'

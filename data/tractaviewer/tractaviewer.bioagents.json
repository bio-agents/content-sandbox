All rights reserved.Summary: We present software to characterize and rank potential therapeutic (drug) targets with data from public databases and present it in a user-friendly format. By understanding potential obstacles to drug development through the gathering and understanding of this information, combined with robust approaches to target validation to generate therapeutic hypotheses, this approach may provide high quality targets, leading the process of drug development to become more efficient and cost-effective. Availability and implementation: The information we gather on potential targets concerns small-molecule druggability (ligandability), suitability for large-molecule approaches (e.g. antibodies) or new modalities (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA or PROTAC), feasibility (availability of resources such as assays and biological knowledge) and potential safety risks (adverse tissue-wise expression, deleterious phenotypes). This information can be termed 'tractability'. We provide visualization agents to understand its components. TractaViewer is available from https://github.com/NeilPearson-Lilly/TractaViewer Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

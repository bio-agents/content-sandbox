                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinaClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based screening using various guide RNA (gRNA) libraries has been executed to identify functional components for a wide range of phenotypes with regard to numerous cell types and organisms. Using data from public CRISPR/Cas9-based screening experiments, we found that the sequences of gRNAs in the library influence CRISPR/Cas9-based screening. As building a standard strategy for correcting results of all gRNA libraries is impractical, we developed SeqCor, an open-source programming bundle that enables researchers to address the result bias potentially triggered by the composition of gRNA sequences via the organization of gRNA in the library used in CRISPR/Cas9-based screening. Furthermore, SeqCor completely computerizes the extraction of sequence features that may influence single-guide RNA knockout efficiency using a machine learning approach. Taken together, we have developed a software program bundle that ought to be beneficial to the CRISPR/Cas9-based screening platform.",

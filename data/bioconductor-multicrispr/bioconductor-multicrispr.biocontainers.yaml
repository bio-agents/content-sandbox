description: This package is for designing Crispr/Cas9 and Prime Editing experiments.
  It contains functions to (1) define and transform genomic targets, (2) find spacers
  (4) count offtarget (mis)matches, and (5) compute Doench2016/2014 targeting efficiency.
  Care has been taken for multicrispr to scale well towards large target sets, enabling
  the design of large Crispr/Cas9 libraries.

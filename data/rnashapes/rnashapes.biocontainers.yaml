description: Rnashape abstraction maps structures to a tree-like domain of shapes,
  retaining adjacency and nesting of structural features, but disregarding helix lengths.
  Shape abstraction integrates well with dynamic programming algorithms, and hence
  it can be applied during structure prediction rather than afterwards. This avoids
  exponential explosion and can still give us a nonheuristic and complete account
  of properties of the molecules folding space.

All rights reserved.Pleiotropy plays an important role in furthering our understanding of the shared genetic architecture of different human diseases and traits. However, exploring and visualizing pleiotropic information with currently publicly available agents is limiting and challenging. To aid researchers in constructing and digesting pleiotropic networks, we present PleioNet, a web-based visualization agent for exploring this information across human diseases and traits. This program provides an intuitive and interactive web interface that seamlessly integrates large database queries with visualizations that enable users to quickly explore complex high-dimensional pleiotropic information. PleioNet works on all modern computer and mobile web browsers, making pleiotropic information readily available to a broad range of researchers and clinicians with diverse technical backgrounds. We expect that PleioNet will be an important agent for studying the underlying pleiotropic connections among human diseases and traits. Availability and implementation: PleioNet is hosted on Google cloud and freely available at http://www.pleionet.com/.",

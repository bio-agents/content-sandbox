Various studies have excavated the potential prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients based on gene expression profiles. However, most of these reported biomarkers lack independent validation in multiple cohorts. Herein, we collected 35 datasets with long-term follow-up clinical information from TCGA (2 cohorts), GEO (32 cohorts), and Roepman study (1 cohort), and developed a web server named OSluca (Online consensus Survival for Lung Cancer) to assess the prognostic value of genes in lung cancer. The input of OSluca is an official gene symbol, and the output web page of OSluca displays the survival analysis summary with a forest plot and a survival table from Cox proportional regression in each cohort and combined cohorts. To test the performance of OSluca, 104 previously reported prognostic biomarkers in lung carcinoma were evaluated in OSluca. In conclusion, OSluca is a highly valuable and interactive prognostic web server for lung cancer. It can be accessed at http:// bioinfo.henu.edu.cn/LUCA/LUCAList.jsp.",

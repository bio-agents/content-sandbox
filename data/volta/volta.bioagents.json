    "description": "VOLTA is a Python network analysis package, suited for different types of networks but with a focus on co-expression network analysis. The goal of VOLTA is to provide all functionalities needed for a comprehensive network analysis and comparison in a single package. Its aim is to expose all functionalities in order to allow users to build their own analysis pipelines and adjust functionalities as needed. Additional complete analysis pipelines are provided in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Network analysis is a powerful approach to investigate biological systems. It is often applied to study gene co-expression patterns derived from transcriptomics experiments. Even though co-expression analysis is widely used, there is still a lack of agents that are open and customizable on the basis of different network types and analysis scenarios (e.g. through function accessibility), but are also suitable for novice users by providing complete analysis pipelines. Results: We developed VOLTA, a Python package suited for complex co-expression network analysis. VOLTA is designed to allow users direct access to the individual functions, while they are also provided with complete analysis pipelines. Moreover, VOLTA offers when possible multiple algorithms applicable to each analytical step (e.g. multiple community detection or clustering algorithms are provided), hence providing the user with the possibility to perform analysis tailored to their needs. This makes VOLTA highly suitable for experienced users who wish to build their own analysis pipelines for a wide range of networks as well as for novice users for which a 'plug and play' system is provided.",

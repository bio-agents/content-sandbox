description: R/GSEPD is a bioinformatics package for R to help disambiguate transcriptome
  samples (a matrix of RNA-Seq counts at transcript IDs) by automating differential
  expression (with DESeq2), then gene set enrichment (with GOSeq), and finally a N-dimensional
  projection to quantify in which ways each sample is like either treatment group.

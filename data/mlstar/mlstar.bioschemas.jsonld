      "sc:description": "Automatic multilocus and core genome sequence typing in R.\n\nAn easy way of MLSTyping your genomes in R.\n\nThis R package allows you to easily determine the Multi Locus Sequence Type (MLST) of your genomes. It also works as an interface between PubMLST through their RESTful API, so you don't have to bother downloading and collecting files: the application does it automatically. Today the package works in Unix-based systems.\n\nIf you use MLSTar in your publications, please cite:.\n\nNote: cgMLST and wgMLST are not yet fully supported since the RESTful API interphase for theses cases is a little different than the one for the standard 7 loci schemes. See issues#11 for more details",

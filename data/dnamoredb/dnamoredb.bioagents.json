Deoxyribozymes, DNA enzymes or simply DNAzymes are single-stranded oligo-deoxyribonucleotide molecules that, like proteins and ribozymes, possess the ability to perform catalysis. Although DNAzymes have not yet been found in living organisms, they have been isolated in the laboratory through in vitro selection. The selected DNAzyme sequences have the ability to catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions, utilizing DNA, RNA, peptides or small organic compounds as substrates.",

Although DNAzymes have not yet been found in living organisms, they have been isolated in the laboratory through in vitro selection. The selected DNAzyme sequences have the ability to catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions, utilizing DNA, RNA, peptides or small organic compounds as substrates. DNAmoreDB is a comprehensive database resource for DNAzymes that collects and organizes the following types of information: sequences, conditions of the selection procedure, catalyzed reactions, kinetic parameters, substrates, cofactors, structural information whenever available, and literature references. Currently, DNAmoreDB contains information about DNAzymes that catalyze 20 different reactions. We included a submission form for new data, a REST-based API system that allows users to retrieve the database contents in a machine-readable format, and keyword and BLASTN search features. The database is publicly available at https://www.genesilico.pl/DNAmoreDB/.",

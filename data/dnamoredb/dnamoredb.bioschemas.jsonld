      "sc:description": "DNAmoreDB is a database of DNAzymes. Deoxyribozymes, DNA enzymes or simply DNAzymes are single-stranded oligo-deoxyribonucleotide molecules that, like proteins and ribozymes, possess the ability to perform catalysis. Although DNAzymes have not yet been found in living organisms, they have been isolated in the laboratory through in vitro selection. The selected DNAzyme sequences have the ability to catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions, utilizing DNA, RNA, peptides or small organic compounds as substrates.",

                "abstract": "© 2021 American Chemical SocietyMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a standard agent to correlate the structure and function of biomolecules and significant advances have been made in the study of proteins and their complexes. A major drawback of conventional MD simulations is the difficulty and cost of obtaining converged results, especially when exploring potential energy surfaces containing considerable energy barriers. This limits the wide use of MD calculations to determine the thermodynamic properties of biomolecular processes. Indeed, this is true when considering the conformational entropy of such processes, which is ultimately critical in assessing the simulations’ convergence. Alternatively, a wide range of structure-based models (SBMs) has been used in the literature to unravel the basic mechanisms of biomolecular dynamics. These models introduce simplifications that focus on the relevant aspects of the physical process under study. Because of this, SBMs incorporate the need to modify the force field definition and parameters to target specific biophysical simulations. Here we introduce SBMOpenMM, a Python library to build force fields for SBMs, that uses the OpenMM framework to create and run SBM simulations. The code is flexible and user-friendly and profits from the high customizability and performance provided by the OpenMM platform.",

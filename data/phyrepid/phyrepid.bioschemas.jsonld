      "sc:description": "PhyRepID is a comparative phylogenomics approach for large-scale quantification of protein repeat evolution.\n\nProtein repeats consisting of domains or motifs are involved in key biological processes such as neural development, host-pathogen interactions, and speciation. Expansion and contraction of these repeats can strongly impact protein function as was shown for KNL1 and PRDM9. However, these known cases could only be identified manually and were previously incorrectly reported as conserved in large-scale analyses, because signatures of repeat evolution are difficult to resolve automatically. We developed PhyRepID to compare protein domain repeat evolution and analysed 4939 groups of orthologous proteins (OGs) from 14 vertebrate species.",

      "sc:description": "COGENT (COnsistency of Gene Expression NeTworks) is an R package designed to aid the construction of gene co-expression networks without the need for annotation or other external validation data. COGENT can be used to choose between competing co-expression measures (e.g. Pearson vs. Kendall correlation coefficients), as well as to inform score cut-off choice. While designed for gene expression data, COGENT can be applied to other cases where network construction relies on similarity profiling, e.g. microbiome or synthetic lethality data.",

description: cfDNA fragment size metrics are important features for utilizing liquid
  biopsy in tumor early detection, diagnosis, therapy personlization and monitoring.
  Analyzing and visualizing insert size metrics could be time intensive. This package
  intends to simplify this exploration process, and it offers two sets of functions
  for data characterization and data visualization.

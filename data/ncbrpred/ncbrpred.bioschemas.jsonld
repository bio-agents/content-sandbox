In which multi-label learning framework and sequence labeling model were employed. It improved performance of nucleic acid binding residue prediction whlie maintaining a low cross-prediction rate, which is an important complement to existing methods. The framework and working process of NCBRPred are shown in Fig. 1. For more information please refer to our paper.",

  "sc:description": "Considering pathological genetic variants within the context of the human interactome network can help understanding the intricate genotype-to-phenotype relationships behind human diseases. It allows, for instance, to distinguish between changes that totally suppress a gene product (i.e. node removal) from the ones that might affect only one of its functions, modulating the way in which the protein interacts with its partners (i.e. edge-specific or edgetic1). dSysMap is a resource for the systematic mapping of disease-related missense mutations on the structurally annotated binary human interactome from Interactome3D.",

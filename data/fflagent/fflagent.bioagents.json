    "description": "A Web Server for Transcription Factor and miRNA Feed Forward Loop Analysis in Human.\n\nFFLagent is a webserver for analyzing Feed Forward Loop (FFL) regulatory motifs among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes. FFLs potentially regulate thousands of target genes in facilitating spatiotemporal avoidance or noise buffering and play important roles in biological processes and diseases (see Refs. PMIDs: 20157565 and 24307685 ). It integrated TF-target data from hTFtarget and miR-target data from several predicted and validated databases. Except for identifying FFLs, FFLagents can also be used to search miR-target and TF-target information",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two kinds of important regulators for transcriptional and post-Transcriptional regulations. Understanding cross-Talks between the two regulators and their targets is critical to reveal complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed FFLagent, a web server for detecting potential feed forward loop (FFL) of TF-miRNA-Target regulation in human. In FFLagent, we integrated comprehensive regulations of TF-Target and miRNA-Target, and developed two functional modules: (i) The 'FFL Analysis' module can detect potential FFLs and internal regulatory networks in a user-defined gene set. FFLagent also provides three levels of evidence to illustrate the reliability for each FFL and enrichment functions for co-Target genes of the same TF and miRNA; (ii) The 'Browse FFLs' module displays FFLs comprised of differentially or specifically expressed TFs and miRNAs and their target genes in cancers. FFLagent is a valuable resource for investigating gene expression regulation and mechanism study in biological processes and diseases.",

    "description": "An Approach to Identify Individual Functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Isoform MicroRNAs | MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play important roles in disease risk and development, especially cancer. Importantly, when SNPs are located in pre-miRNAs, they affect their splicing mechanism and change the function of miRNAs. To improve disease risk assessment, we propose an approach and developed a software agent, IsomiR_Find, to identify disease phenotype-related SNPs and isomiRs in individuals. Our approach is based on the individual's samples, with SNP information extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project. SNPs were mapped to pre-miRNAs based on whole-genome coordinates and then SNP-pre-miRNA sequences were constructed. Moreover, we developed matpred2, a software agent to identify the four splicing sites of mature miRNAs",

Importantly, when SNPs are located in pre-miRNAs, they affect their splicing mechanism and change the function of miRNAs. To improve disease risk assessment, we propose an approach and developed a software agent, IsomiR_Find, to identify disease/phenotype-related SNPs and isomiRs in individuals. Our approach is based on the individual's samples, with SNP information extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project. SNPs were mapped to pre-miRNAs based on whole-genome coordinates and then SNP-pre-miRNA sequences were constructed. Moreover, we developed matpred2, a software agent to identify the four splicing sites of mature miRNAs. Using matpred2, we identified isomiRs and then verified them by searching within individual miRNA sequencing data. Our approach yielded biomarkers for biological experiments, mined functions of miRNAs and SNPs, improved disease risk assessment, and provided a way to achieve individualized precision medicine.",

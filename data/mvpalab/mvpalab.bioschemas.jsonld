      "sc:description": "MVPAlab is a MATLAB-based and very flexible decoding agentbox for multidimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. The MVPAlab Agentbox implements several machine learning algorithms to compute multivariate pattern analyses, cross-classification, temporal generalization matrices and feature and frequency contribution analyses. This agentbox has been designed to include an easy-to-use and very intuitive graphic user interface and data representation software, which makes MVPAlab a very convenient agent for those users with few or no previous coding experience. However, MVPAlab is not for beginners only, as it implements several high and low-level routines allowing more experienced users to design their own projects in a highly flexible manner.",

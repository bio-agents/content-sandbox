                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Single cell RNA sequencing provides unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously explore the transcriptomic and immune receptor diversity of T and B cells. However, there are limited agents available that simultaneously analyse large multi-omics datasets integrated with metadata such as patient and clinical information. Results: We developed VDJView, which permits the simultaneous or independent analysis and visualisation of gene expression, immune receptors, and clinical metadata of both T and B cells. This agent is implemented as an easy-to-use R shiny web-application, which integrates numerous gene expression and TCR analysis agents, and accepts data from plate-based sorted or high-throughput single cell platforms. We utilised VDJView to analyse several 10X scRNA-seq datasets, including a recent dataset of 150,000 CD8+ T cells with available gene expression, TCR sequences, quantification of 15 surface proteins, and 44 antigen specificities (across viruses, cancer, and self-antigens). We performed quality control, filtering of tetramer non-specific cells, clustering, random sampling and hypothesis testing to discover antigen specific gene signatures which were associated with immune cell differentiation states and clonal expansion across the pathogen specific T cells. We also analysed 563 single cells (plate-based sorted) obtained from 11 subjects, revealing clonally expanded T and B cells across primary cancer tissues and metastatic lymph-node. These immune cells clustered with distinct gene signatures according to the breast cancer molecular subtype. VDJView has been tested in lab meetings and peer-to-peer discussions, showing effective data generation and discussion without the need to consult bioinformaticians. Conclusions: VDJView enables researchers without profound bioinformatics skills to analyse immune scRNA-seq data, integrating and visualising this with clonality and metadata profiles, thus accelerating the process of hypothesis testing, data interpretation and discovery of cellular heterogeneity.

description: COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely
  used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
  COBRApy is a constraint-based modeling package that is designed to accommodate the
  biological complexity of the next generation of COBRA models and provides access
  to commonly used COBRA methods, such as flux balance analysis, flux variability
  analysis, and gene deletion analyses.

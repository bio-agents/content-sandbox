  description: agents for early stage alignment file processing
  long_description: " This package contains some agents for processing BAM files, including\n\
    \ .\n   bamsormadup:  parallel sorting and duplicate marking\n   bamcollate2:\
    \  reads BAM and writes BAM reordered such that alignment\n                 or\
    \ collated by query name\n   bammarkduplicates: reads BAM and writes BAM with\
    \ duplicate alignments\n                 marked using the BAM flags field\n  \
    \ bammaskflags: reads BAM and writes BAM while masking (removing) bits\n     \
    \            from the flags column\n   bamrecompress: reads BAM and writes BAM\
    \ with a defined compression\n                  setting. This agent is capable\
    \ of multi-threading.\n   bamsort:       reads BAM and writes BAM resorted by\
    \ coordinates or\n                  query name\n   bamtofastq:    reads BAM and\
    \ writes FastQ; output can be collated\n                  or uncollated by query\
    \ name\n"

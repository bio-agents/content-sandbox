Increasing evidence shows that circular RNAs can directly bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and play an important role in a variety of biological activities. The interactions between circRNAs and RBPs are key to comprehending the mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. Accurately identifying binding sites is very useful for analyzing interactions. In past research, some predictors on the basis of machine learning (ML) have been presented, but prediction accuracy still needs to be ameliorated. Therefore, we present a novel calculation model, CRBPDL, which uses an Adaboost integrated deep hierarchical network to identify the binding sites of circular RNA-RBP. CRBPDL combines five different feature encoding schemes to encode the original RNA sequence, uses deep multiscale residual networks (MSRN) and bidirectional gating recurrent units (BiGRUs) to effectively learn high-level feature representations, it is sufficient to extract local and global context information at the same time. Additionally, a self-attention mechanism is employed to train the robustness of the CRBPDL. Ultimately, the Adaboost algorithm is applied to integrate deep learning (DL) model to improve prediction performance and reliability of the model. To verify the usefulness of CRBPDL, we compared the efficiency with state-of-the-art methods on 37 circular RNA data sets and 31 linear RNA data sets. Moreover, results display that CRBPDL is capable of performing universal, reliable, and robust. The code and data sets are obtainable at https://github.com/nmt315320/ CRBPDL.git.",

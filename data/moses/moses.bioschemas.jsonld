      "sc:description": "A Benchmarking Platform for Molecular Generation Models.\n\nDeep generative models are rapidly becoming popular for the discovery of new molecules and materials. Such models learn on a large collection of molecular structures and produce novel compounds. In this work, we introduce Molecular Sets (MOSES), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. MOSES implements several popular molecular generation models and provides a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated molecules. With MOSES, we aim to standardize the research on molecular generation and facilitate the sharing and comparison of new models.",

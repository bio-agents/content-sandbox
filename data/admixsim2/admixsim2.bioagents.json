                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Computer simulations have been widely applied in population genetics and evolutionary studies. A great deal of effort has been made over the past two decades in developing simulation agents. However, there are not many simulation agents suitable for studying population admixture. Results: We here developed a forward-time simulator, AdmixSim 2, an individual-based agent that can flexibly and efficiently simulate population genomics data under complex evolutionary scenarios. Unlike its previous version, AdmixSim 2 is based on the extended Wright-Fisher model, and it implements many common evolutionary parameters to involve gene flow, natural selection, recombination, and mutation, which allow users to freely design and simulate any complex scenario involving population admixture. AdmixSim 2 can be used to simulate data of dioecious or monoecious populations, autosomes, or sex chromosomes. To our best knowledge, there are no similar agents available for the purpose of simulation of complex population admixture. Using empirical or previously simulated genomic data as input, AdmixSim 2 provides phased haplotype data for the convenience of further admixture-related analyses such as local ancestry inference, association studies, and other applications. We here evaluate the performance of AdmixSim 2 based on simulated data and validated functions via comparative analysis of simulated data and empirical data of African American, Mexican, and Uyghur populations. Conclusions: AdmixSim 2 is a flexible simulation agent expected to facilitate the study of complex population admixture in various situations.",

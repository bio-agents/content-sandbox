    "description": "Sequence-based Detection of DNA-binding Proteins using Multiple-view Features Allied with Feature Selection.\n\nDNA-binding proteins play essential roles in many molecular functions and gene regulation. Therefore, it becomes highly desirable to develop effective computational techniques for detecting DNA-binding proteins. In this paper, we proposed a new method, iDBP-DEP, which performs DNA-binding prediction by using the discriminative feature derived from multi-view feature sources including evolutionary profile, dipeptide composition, and physicochemical properties with feature selection. We evaluated iDBP-DEP on two benchmark datasets, i. e., PDB1075 and PDB594 by rigorous Jackknife test. Compared with the state-of-the-art sequence-based DNA-binding predictors, the proposed iDBP-DEP achieved 1.8 % and 3.0 % improvements of accuracy (Acc) and Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), respectively, on PDB1075 dataset; 7.4 % and 14.8 % improvements of Acc and MCC, respectively, on PDB594",

The independent validation test with PDB186 show that the proposed method achieved the best performances on Acc (80.1 %) and MCC (0.684), which further demonstrated the robustness of iDBP-DEP for the detection of DNA-binding proteins.

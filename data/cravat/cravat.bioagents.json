Academic laboratories and researchers therefore now have access to very large datasets of genomic alterations but limited time and computational resources to analyse their potential biological importance. Here, we provide a web-based application, Cancer-Related Analysis of Variants Agentkit, designed with an easy-to-use interface to facilitate the high-throughput assessment and prioritization of genes and missense alterations important for cancer tumorigenesis. Cancer-Related Analysis of Variants Agentkit provides predictive scores for germline variants, somatic mutations and relative gene importance, as well as annotations from published literature and databases. Results are emailed to users as MS Excel spreadsheets and/or tab-separated text files. Â© 2013 The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.",

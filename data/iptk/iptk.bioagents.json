    "description": "IPTK is a Python library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an Immunopeptidomic(IP) pipeline. The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcritomics and protein structure information for a rich analysis of the identified immunopeptidomes. It also provides a agentbox for integrating and comparing different experiments and/or different runs.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune system as they present peptides to T cells. Mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics is a promising and powerful agent for characterizing the immunopeptidomic landscape of HLA proteins, that is the peptides presented on HLA proteins. Despite the growing interest in the technology, and the recent rise of immunopeptidomics-specific identification pipelines, there is still a gap in data-analysis and software agents that are specialized in analyzing and visualizing immunopeptidomics data. Results: We present the IPTK library which is an open-source Python-based library for analyzing, visualizing, comparing, and integrating different omics layers with the identified peptides for an in-depth characterization of the immunopeptidome. Using different datasets, we illustrate the ability of the library to enrich the result of the identified peptidomes. Also, we demonstrate the utility of the library in developing other software and agents by developing an easy-to-use dashboard that can be used for the interactive analysis of the results. Conclusion: IPTK provides a modular and extendable framework for analyzing and integrating immunopeptidomes with different omics layers. The library is deployed into PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/IPTKL/ and into Bioconda at https://anaconda.org/bioconda/iptkl, while the source code of the library and the dashboard, along with the online tutorials are available at https://github.com/ikmb/ipagentkit.",

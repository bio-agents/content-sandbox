Cluvio supports all major SQL databases like Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, Athena, BigQuery, Snowflake, Presto, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Google Cloud Platform and Exasol.\n\nA web server for Identifying Family of Efflux Proteins in Transporters using Convolutional Neural Networks Model.\n\nWe proposed a new identification method nemed SOMM4mC based on a Markov model which makes use of the transition probability between adjacent nucleotides to identify 4mC site.\n\nDNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) modification occurs mainly in prokaryotic DNA.",

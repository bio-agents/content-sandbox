                "abstract": "Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are transcripts generated by back-splicing. CircRNAs might regulate cellular processes by different mechanisms, including interaction with miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. CircRNAs are pleiotropic molecules whose dysregulation has been linked to human diseases and can drive cancer by impacting gene expression and signaling pathways. The detection of circRNAs aberrantly expressed in disease conditions calls for the investigation of their functions. Here, we propose CircIMPACT, a bioinformatics agent for the integrative analysis of circRNA and gene expression data to facilitate the identification and visualization of the genes whose expression varies according to circRNA expression changes. This agent can highlight regulatory axes potentially governed by circRNAs, which can be prioritized for further experimental study. The usefulness of CircIMPACT is exemplified by a case study analysis of bladder cancer RNA-seq data. The link between circHIPK3 and heparanase (HPSE) expression, due to the circHIPK3-miR558-HPSE regulatory axis previously determined by experimental studies on cell lines, was successfully detected.",

      "sc:description": "BEXIS2 is an open-source community-driven research data management system to support research data management needs of mid to large-scale research projects with multiple sub-projects and up to several hundred researchers. It is a modular and extensible system providing a range of functions to realise the complete data lifecycle from data structure design to data collection, data discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning. Also, itâ€™s an extensible and customisable system that allows for the development of new functions and customisation of its various components from database schemas to the user interface layout, elements and look and feel. BEXIS2 support making research data compatible with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles.  The software is developed based on requirements of the biodiversity and ecology domain that mostly deal with tabular data but is generic enough to serve other domains and data types as well.",

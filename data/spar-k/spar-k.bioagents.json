    "description": "SPar-K (Signal Partitioning using K-means) is a modified version of a standard K-means algorithm designed to cluster vectors containing a sequence of signal (that is, the order in which the elements appear in the vectors is meaningful). In order to detect a possible phase shift or orientation inversion between two vectors, this program allows computing distances between two vectors by shifting and flipping them.",

All rights reserved.Summary: We present SPar-K (Signal Partitioning with K-means), a method to search for archetypical chromatin architectures by partitioning a set of genomic regions characterized by chromatin signal profiles around ChIP-seq peaks and other kinds of functional sites. This method efficiently deals with problems of data heterogeneity, limited misalignment of anchor points and unknown orientation of asymmetric patterns. Availability and implementation: SPar-K is a C++ program available on GitHub https://github.com/romaingroux/SPar-K and Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/r/rgroux/spar-k. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "description": "A webserver and software with motif control for fragment-based design of RNAs.\n\nRNAfbinv is a fragment based RNA design agent. It uses a simulated annealing process to optimize a 2D RNA structure.\n\nThe similarity is based on fragment based design. A tree alignment is done based on nodes (structural motifs).\n\nNodes are comparable if they are both bounded motifs (stems) or unbounded motifs (multi loop, interior loops, bulges ect...).\n\nSequence constraints (Optional):.\n\nGeneration method: incaRNAtion Random initial guess User defined Single sequence for multiple runs.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.RNA design has conceptually evolved from the inverse RNA folding problem. In the classical inverse RNA problem, the user inputs an RNA secondary structure and receives an output RNA sequence that folds into it. Although modern RNA design methods are based on the same principle, a finer control over the resulting sequences is sought. As an important example, a substantial number of non-coding RNA families show high preservation in specific regions, while being more flexible in others and this information should be utilized in the design. By using the additional information, RNA design agents can help solve problems of practical interest in the growing fields of synthetic biology and nanotechnology. incaRNAfbinv 2.0 utilizes a fragment-based approach, enabling a control of specific RNA secondary structure motifs. The new version allows significantly more control over the general RNA shape, and also allows to express specific restrictions over each motif separately, in addition to other advanced features.",

OPA2Vec uses mainly metadata from the ontology in the form of annotation properties as the main source of data. It also uses formal ontology axioms as well as entity-concept associations as sources of information. This document provides instructions on how to run OPA2Vec as a agent and contains also a detailed documentation of the implementation of OPA2Vec for users willing to change the code according to their needs which is quite easy.",

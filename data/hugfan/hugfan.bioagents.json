                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s) 2022.Networks consisting of molecular interactions are intrinsically dynamical systems of an organism. These interactions curated in molecular interaction databases are still not complete and contain false positives introduced by high-throughput screening experiments. In this study, we propose a framework to integrate interactions of functional associated protein-coding genes from 31 data sources to reconstruct a network with high coverage and quality. For each interaction, 369 features were constructed including properties of both the interaction and the involved genes. The training and validation sets were built on the pathway interactions as positives and the potential negative instances resulting from our proposed semi-supervised strategy. Random forest classification method was then applied to train and predict multiple times to give a score for each interaction. After setting a threshold estimated by a Binomial distribution, a Human protein-coding Gene Functional Association Network (HuGFAN) was reconstructed with 20 383 genes and 1185 429 high confidence interactions. Then, HuGFAN was compared with other networks from data sources with respect to network properties, suggesting that HuGFAN is more function and pathway related. Finally, HuGFAN was applied to identify cancer driver through two famous network-based methods (DriverNet and HotNet2) to show its outstanding performance compared with other networks.

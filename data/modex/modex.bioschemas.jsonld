      "sc:description": "A text mining system for extracting mode of regulation of transcription factor-gene regulatory interaction.\n\nDeciphering the network of TF-target interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression) is an important step toward understanding the regulatory pathways that underlie complex traits. There are many experimental, computational, and manually curated databases of TF-gene interactions. In particular, high-throughput ChIP-seq datasets provide a large-scale map or transcriptional regulatory interactions.\n\nModEx can be installed using the GitHub repository. All of the dependencies will be installed via setup.py script.\n\nSaman Farahmand, Todd Riley, Kourosh Zarringhalam, \"ModEx: A text mining system for extracting mode of regulation of Transcription Factor-gene regulatory interaction\", BioRxiv, 2019",

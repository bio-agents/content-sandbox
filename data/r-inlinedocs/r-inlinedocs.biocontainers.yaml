description: Generates Rd files from R source code with comments. The main features
  of the default syntax are that (1) docs are defined in comments near the relevant
  code, (2) function argument names are not repeated in comments, and (3) examples
  are defined in R code, not comments. It is also easy to define a new syntax.

Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: TFmiR2 is a freely available web server for constructing and analyzing integrated transcription factor (TF) and microRNA (miRNA) co-regulatory networks for human and mouse. TFmiR2 generates tissue-and biological process-specific networks for the set of deregulated genes and miRNAs provided by the user. Furthermore, the service can now identify key driver genes and miRNAs in the constructed networks by utilizing the graph theoretical concept of a minimum connected dominating set. These putative key players as well as the newly implemented four-node TF-miRNA motifs yield novel insights that may assist in developing new therapeutic approaches.",

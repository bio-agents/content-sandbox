This process is very computationally expensive, especially when large data sets are analyzed. In this paper we present GPU ISAC, a newly developed, GPU-accelerated version of the established Iterative Stable Alignment and Clustering (ISAC) algorithm for 2D images and generating class averages. While the previously existing implementation of ISAC relied on a computer cluster, GPU ISAC enables users to produce high quality 2D class averages from large-scale data sets on a single desktop machine equipped with affordable, consumer-grade GPUs such as Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 TI cards. With only two such cards GPU ISAC matches the performance of twelve high end cluster nodes and, using high performance GPUs, is able to produce class averages from a million particles in between six to thirteen hours, depending on data set quality and box size. We also show GPU ISAC to scale linearly in all input dimensions, and thereby capable of scaling well with the increasing data load demand of future data sets. Further user experience improvements integrate GPU ISAC seamlessly into the existing SPHIRE GUI, as well as the TranSPHIRE on-the-fly processing pipeline. It is open source and can be downloaded at https://gitlab.gwdg.de/mpi-dortmund/sphire/cuISAC/",

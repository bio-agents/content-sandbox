    "description": "LBD (Lymphoma Biomarker Database) is a manually curated database of literature-supported biomarkers for lymphoma. It contains 793 biomarkers (715 single biomarkers and 78 combined biomarkers) for different subtypes of lymphoma which have been verified by experiments. The biomarkers are collected from 978 literatures from PubMed and are categorized into molecular (DNA, RNA, protein, chemical), cellular (cells or cell counts), image (imaging technologies or parameters), histopathological (characteristics of individuals' histopathological functioning), physiological (characteristics of individuals' normal functioning) biomarkers. By browsing and searching LBD, users can get access to comprehensive information about lymphoma biomarkers conveniently.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s).Lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease caused by malignant proliferation of lymphocytes, resulting in significant mortality worldwide. While more and more lymphoma biomarkers have been identified with the advent and development of precision medicine, there are currently no databases dedicated to systematically gathering these scattered treasures. Therefore, we developed a lymphoma biomarker database (LBD) to curate experimentally validated lymphoma biomarkers in this study. LBD consists of 793 biomarkers extracted from 978 articles covering diverse subtypes of lymphomas, including 715 single and 78 combined biomarkers. These biomarkers can be categorized into molecular, cellular, image, histopathological, physiological and other biomarkers with various functions such as prognosis, diagnosis and treatment. As a manually curated database that provides comprehensive information about lymphoma biomarkers, LBD is helpful for personalized diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma.

Test configurations based on either the Astex, the Iridium HT, the Platinum, or the combination of all three criteria catalogs. (Note that RSCC as an electron density validation criteria was replaced by EDIAm scoring).",

Computational methods in this area rely on high quality validation datasets which are usually manually assembled. Due to the increase in published structures as well as the increasing demand for specially tailored validation datasets, automatic procedures should be adopted. Results StructureProfiler is a new agent for automatic, objective and customizable profiling of X-ray protein structures based on the most frequently applied selection criteria currently in use to assemble benchmark datasets. As examples, four dataset configurations (Astex, Iridium, Platinum, combined), all results of the combined tests and the list of all PDB Ids passing the combined criteria set are attached in theSupplementary Material.",

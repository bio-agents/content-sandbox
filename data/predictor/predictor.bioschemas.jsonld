      "sc:description": "Novel Consensus Architecture To Improve Performance of Large-Scale Multitask Deep Learning QSAR Models.\n\nAdvances in the development of high-throughput screening and automated chemistry have rapidly accelerated the production of chemical and biological data, much of them freely accessible through literature aggregator services such as ChEMBL and PubChem. Here, we explore how to use this comprehensive mapping of chemical biology space to support the development of large-scale quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. We propose a new deep learning consensus architecture (DLCA) that combines consensus and multitask deep learning approaches together to generate large-scale QSAR models.",

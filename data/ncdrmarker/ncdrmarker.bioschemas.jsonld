      "sc:description": "A computational method for identifying non-coding RNA signatures of drug resistance based on heterogeneous network.\n\nncDRMarker is an integrated bioinformatic platform that enable users to prioritize candidate ncRNAs involved in drug resistance. ncDRMarker uses a simple but effective computational technique, random walk with restart (RWR), to identify chemoresistance ncRNA biomarkers. The method fully exploits the heterogeneous biological interactions of the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA composite network, which was constructed by integrating experimentally validated interactions (protein-protein , miRNA-target and miRNA-lncRNA interactions). The identified ncRNAs may be targeted to overcome drug resistance and help realize individual treatment.",

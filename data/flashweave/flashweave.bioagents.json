    "description": "Rapid Inference of Direct Interactions in Large-Scale Ecological Networks from Heterogeneous Microbial Sequencing Data | Inference of microbial interaction networks from large-scale heterogeneous abundance data | FlashWeave predicts ecological interactions between microbes from large-scale compositional abundance data (i.e. OTU tables constructed from sequencing data) through statistical co-occurrence or co-abundance. It reports direct associations, with adjustment for bystander effects and other confounders, and can furthermore integrate environmental or technical factors into the analysis of microbial systems",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The AuthorsThe availability of large-scale metagenomic sequencing data can facilitate the understanding of microbial ecosystems in unprecedented detail. However, current computational methods for predicting ecological interactions are hampered by insufficient statistical resolution and limited computational scalability. They also do not integrate metadata, which can reduce the interpretability of predicted ecological patterns. Here, we present FlashWeave, a computational approach based on a flexible Probabilistic Graphical Model framework that integrates metadata and predicts direct microbial interactions from heterogeneous microbial abundance data sets with hundreds of thousands of samples. FlashWeave outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse benchmarking challenges in terms of runtime and accuracy. We use FlashWeave to analyze a cross-study data set of 69,818 publicly available human gut samples and produce, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most diverse network of predicted, direct gastrointestinal microbial interactions to date. FlashWeave is freely available for download here: https://github.com/meringlab/FlashWeave.jl. Spurious associations and computational complexity currently hinder ecological network inference from cross-study metagenomic data. Tackmann et al. present FlashWeave, a novel co-occurrence method that predicts interpretable microbial interaction networks through graphical model inference. FlashWeave is highly scalable and addresses data heterogeneity. They validate the method in extensive benchmarks on diverse synthetic and real-world data sets.",

Although other prognostic factors and prognostic prediction agents have been reported in many published studies, a convenient, accurate and specific prognostic prediction software for clinicians has not been developed. The purpose of our research was to develop this type of software that can analyze subdivided T and N staging and additional factors to predict prognostic risk and the corresponding mean and median survival time and 1-5-year survival rates of patients with resected T1-3N0-2M0 NSCLC. Results:Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, we determined the independent prognostic factors and obtained a prognostic index (PI) eq",

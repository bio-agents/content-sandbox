Results: Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, we determined the independent prognostic factors and obtained a prognostic index (PI) eq. PI = ∑βixi. =0.379X1-0.403X2-0.267X51-0.167X61-0.298X62 + 0.460X71 + 0.617X72-0.344X81-0.105X91-0.243X92 + 0.305X101 + 0.508X102 + 0.754X103 + 0.143X111 + 0.170X112 + 0.434X113-0.327X122-0.247X123 + 0.517X133 + 0.340X134 + 0.457X143 + 0.419X144 + 0.407X145. Using the PI equation, we determined the PI value of every patient. According to the quantile of the PI value, patients were divided into three risk groups: low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with significantly different survival rates. Meanwhile, we obtained the mean and median survival times and 1-5-year survival rates of the three groups. We developed the RNSCLC-PRSP software which is freely available on the web at http://www.rnsclcpps.com with all major browsers supported to determine the prognostic risk and associated survival of patients with resected T1-3N0-2 M0 non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions: After prognostic factor analysis, prognostic risk grouping and corresponding survival assessment, we developed a novel software program. It is practical and convenient for clinicians to evaluate the prognostic risk and corresponding survival of patients with resected T1-3N0-2M0 NSCLC. Additionally, it has guiding significance for clinicians to make decisions about complementary treatment for patients.",

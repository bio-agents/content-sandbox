description: Normalisation, testing for differential variability and differential
  methylation and gene set testing for data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation
  arrays. The normalisation procedure is subset-quantile within-array normalisation
  (SWAN), which allows Infinium I and II type probes on a single array to be normalised
  together. The test for differential variability is based on an empirical Bayes version
  of Levene's test. Differential methylation testing is performed using RUV, which
  can adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data by using
  negative control probes. Gene ontology analysis is performed by taking into account
  the number of probes per gene on the array, as well as taking into account multi-gene
  associated probes.

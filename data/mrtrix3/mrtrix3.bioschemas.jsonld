      "sc:description": "A fast, flexible and open software framework for medical image processing and visualisation | MRtrix3 is an open-source, cross-platform software package for medical image processing, analysis and visualisation, with a particular emphasis on the investigation of the brain using diffusion MRI. It is implemented using a fast, modular and flexible general-purpose code framework for image data access and manipulation, enabling efficient development of new applications, whilst retaining high computational performance and a consistent command-line interface between applications. In this article, we provide a high-level overview of the features of the MRtrix3 framework and general-purpose image processing applications provided with the software",

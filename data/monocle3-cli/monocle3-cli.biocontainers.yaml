description: A set of wrappers for individual components of the monocle3 package.
  functions r packages are hard to call when building workflows outside of r, so this
  package adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing. intermediate
  steps are currently monocle3 r objects, but the ultimate objective is to have language-agnostic
  intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using a variety of software packages.

description: Many agents for data analysis are not available in R, but are present
  in public repositories like conda. The Herper package provides a comprehensive set
  of functions to interact with the conda package managament system. With Herper users
  can install, manage and run conda packages from the comfort of their R session.
  Herper also provides an ad-hoc approach to handling external system requirements
  for R packages. For people developing packages with python conda dependencies we
  recommend using basilisk (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/basilisk.html)
  to internally support these system requirments pre-hoc.

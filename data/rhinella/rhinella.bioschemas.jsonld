      "sc:description": "The common toad Rhinella arenarum is widely distributed in Argentina, where it is utilised as an autochthonous model in ecotoxicological research and environmental toxicology. However, the lack of a reference genome makes molecular assays and gene expression studies difficult to carry out on this non-model species. To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis on R. arenarum larvae through massive RNA sequencing, followed by de novo assembly, annotation, and gene prediction. We obtained 57,407 well-annotated transcripts representing 99.4% of transcriptome completeness (available at http: rhinella.uncoma.edu.ar). We also defined a set of 52,800 high-confidence lncRNA transcripts and demonstrated the reliability of the transcriptome data to perform phylogenetic analysis",

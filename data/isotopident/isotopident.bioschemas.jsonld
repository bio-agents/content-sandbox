  "sc:description": "Isotopident can estimate the theoretical isotopic distribution of a peptide or protein, a polynucleotide and a chemical compound from its composition (sequence of amino acids expressed in either 1-letter code, sequence of amino acids expressed in 3-letter code, sequence of nucleotides or its chemical formula). Isotopident can also compute its monoisotopic mass. and predict the most likely isotope combination and the exact mass of the given input.",

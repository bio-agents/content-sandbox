description: 'Various methods for clustering and cluster validation. Fixed point clustering.
  Linear regression clustering. Clustering by merging Gaussian mixture components.
  Symmetric and asymmetric discriminant projections for visualisation of the separation
  of groupings. Cluster validation statistics for distance based clustering including
  corrected Rand index. Cluster-wise cluster stability assessment. Methods for estimation
  of the number of clusters: Calinski-Harabasz, Tibshirani and Walther''s prediction
  strength, Fang and Wang''s bootstrap stability. Gaussian/multinomial mixture fitting
  for mixed continuous/categorical variables. Variable-wise statistics for cluster
  interpretation. DBSCAN clustering. Interface functions for many clustering methods
  implemented in R, including estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam and
  clara. Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures.'

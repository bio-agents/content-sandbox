                "abstract": "© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Since the first reported case in Wuhan in late 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, dramatically impacting the lives of millions of citizens. To deal with the severe crisis resulting from the pandemic, worldwide institutions have been forced to make decisions that profoundly affect the socio-economic realm. In this sense, researchers from diverse knowledge areas are investigating the behavior of the disease in a rush against time. In both cases, the lack of reliable data has been an obstacle to carry out such tasks with accuracy. To tackle this challenge, COnVIDa (https://convida.inf.um.es) has been designed and developed as a user-friendly agent that easily gathers rigorous multidisciplinary data related to the COVID-19 pandemic from different data sources. In particular, the pandemic expansion is analyzed with variables of health nature, but also social ones, mobility, etc. Besides, COnVIDa permits to smoothly join such data, compare and download them for further analysis. Due to the open-science nature of the project, COnVIDa is easily extensible to any other region of the planet. In this way, COnVIDa becomes a data facilitator for decision-making processes, as well as a catalyst for new scientific researches related to this pandemic.",

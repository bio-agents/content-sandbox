description: SOLAR is the standard software program to perform linkage and association
  mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and
  complexity. This package allows the user to exploit the variance component methods
  implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree
  and phenotype data. It also parses the model output and contains summary and plotting
  functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel
  computing of the linkage and association analyses, that makes the calculation of
  genome-wide scans more efficient. See <http://solar.txbiomedgenetics.org/> for more
  information about SOLAR.

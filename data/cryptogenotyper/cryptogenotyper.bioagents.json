The CryptoGenotyper is a fast and reproducible agent that can be used to classify the genotype of Cryptosporidium samples by directly analyzing the DNA electropherogram files that correspond to two of its characteristic gene markers: SSU rRNA and gp60.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to both humans and animals through zoonotic or anthroponotic means. When a host is infected with this parasite, it causes a gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. To understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and gp60 genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a Cryptosporidium genotyping agent, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common Cryptosporidium gene targets (SSU rRNA and gp60) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3% (428/431) and 95.1% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6% (947/991) of gp60 chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly agent can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common Cryptosporidium gene targets.",

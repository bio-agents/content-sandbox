      "sc:description": "he SARS-CoV-2 mutation browser is easy, efficient, and user friendly that only deals with novel coronavirus and display the viral genome variation around the globe on a single platform for the convenience of the researchers and virologists. The browser features comprehensive integration of a genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2along with their metadata information from NGDC, NCBI, and GISAID. Furthermore, it is open access mutation browser that displays the region and gene-wise (5UTR, ORFab, S, E, M, N, 3UTR) distribution of mutation data of particular virus isolate and also provides position and statistics of mutations. Moreover, viral primer sequence information is also displayed on the same page “primer infopedia”.",

                "abstract": "Recent surges in mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies demand a concurrent rise in speedy and optimized data processing agents and pipelines. Although several stand-alone bioinformatics agents exist that provide protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, we developed Protein Interaction Network Extractor (PINE) as a fully automated, user-friendly, graphical user interface application for visualization and exploration of global proteome and post-translational modification (PTM) based networks. PINE also supports overlaying differential expression, statistical significance thresholds, and PTM sites on functionally enriched visualization networks to gain insights into proteome-wide regulatory mechanisms and PTM-mediated networks. To illustrate the relevance of the agent, we explore the total proteome and its PTM-associated relationships in two different nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse models to demonstrate different context-specific case studies. The strength of this agent relies in its ability to (1) perform accurate protein identifier mapping to resolve ambiguity, (2) retrieve interaction data from multiple publicly available PPI databases, and (3) assimilate these complex networks into functionally enriched pathways, ontology categories, and terms. Ultimately, PINE can be used as an extremely powerful agent for novel hypothesis generation to understand underlying disease mechanisms.",

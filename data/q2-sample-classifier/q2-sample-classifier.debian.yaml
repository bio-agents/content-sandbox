  description: QIIME 2 plugin for machine learning prediction of sample data
  long_description: " QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome\
    \ analysis\n package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables\n\
    \ researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with\n\
    \ publication-quality figures and statistical results.\n Key features:\n  * Integrated\
    \ and automatic tracking of data provenance\n  * Semantic type system\n  * Plugin\
    \ system for extending microbiome analysis functionality\n  * Support for multiple\
    \ types of user interfaces (e.g. API, command line,\n graphical)\n .\n QIIME 2\
    \ is a complete redesign and rewrite of the QIIME 1 microbiome analysis\n pipeline.\
    \ QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations of QIIME 1, while\n retaining the\
    \ features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used analysis\n pipeline.\n\
    \ .\n QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline.\n\
    \ New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME 2 plugins. You\n\
    \ can view a list of plugins that are currently available on the QIIME 2 plugin\n\
    \ availability page. The future plugins page lists plugins that are being\n developed.\n\
    \ .\n Microbiome studies often aim to predict outcomes or differentiate samples\n\
    \ based on their microbial compositions, tasks that can be efficiently\n performed\
    \ by supervised learning methods. The q2-sample-classifier plugin\n makes these\
    \ methods more accessible, reproducible, and interpretable to\n a broad audience\
    \ of microbiologists, clinicians, and others who wish to\n utilize supervised\
    \ learning methods for predicting sample characteristics\n based on microbiome\
    \ composition or other \"omics\" data\n"

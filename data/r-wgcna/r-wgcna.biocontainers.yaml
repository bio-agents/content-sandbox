description: Functions necessary to perform Weighted Correlation Network Analysis
  on high-dimensional data as originally described in Horvath and Zhang (2005) <>
  and Langfelder and Horvath (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-559>. Includes functions
  for rudimentary data cleaning, construction of correlation networks, module identification,
  summarization, and relating of variables and modules to sample traits. Also includes
  a number of utility functions for data manipulation and visualization.

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 SabziNezhad and Jalili.Detecting protein complexes from the Protein-Protein interaction network (PPI) is the essence of discovering the rules of the cellular world. There is a large amount of PPI data available, generated from high throughput experimental data. The enormous size of the data persuaded us to use computational methods instead of experimental methods to detect protein complexes. In past years, many researchers presented their algorithms to detect protein complexes. Most of the presented algorithms use current static PPI networks. New researches proved the dynamicity of cellular systems, and so, the PPI is not static over time. In this paper, we introduce DPCT to detect protein complexes from dynamic PPI networks. In the proposed method, TAP and GO data are used to make a weighted PPI network and to reduce the noise of PPI. Gene expression data are also used to make dynamic subnetworks from PPI. A memetic algorithm is used to bicluster gene expression data and to create a dynamic subnetwork for each bicluster. Experimental results show that DPCT can detect protein complexes with better correctness than state-of-the-art detection algorithms. The source code and datasets of DPCT used can be found at https://github.com/alisn72/DPCT.",

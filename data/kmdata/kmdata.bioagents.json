                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.We created a database of reconstructed patient-level data from published clinical trials that includes multiple time-to-event outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival. Outcomes were extracted from Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves reported in 153 oncology Phase III clinical trial publications identified through a PubMed search of clinical trials in breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer, published between 2014 and 2016. For each trial that met our search criteria, we curated study-level information and digitized all reported KM curves with the software Digitizelt. We then used the digitized KM survival curves to estimate (possibly censored) patient-level time-to-event outcomes. Collections of time-to-event datasets from completed trials can be used to support the choice of appropriate trial designs for future clinical studies. Patient-level data allow investigators to tailor clinical trial designs to diseases and classes of treatments. Patient-level data also allow investigators to estimate the operating characteristics (e.g. power and type I error rate) of candidate statistical designs and methods.

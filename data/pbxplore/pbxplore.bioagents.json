    "description": "PBxplore is a suite of agents dedicated to Protein Block (PB) analysis. \n\nProtein Blocks are structural prototypes defined by de Brevern et al. (Proteins, 2000, PMID: 11025540). The 3-dimensional local structure of a protein backbone can be modelled as an 1-dimensional sequence of PBs. In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented by one of the sixteen available Protein Blocks.",

Proteins are highly dynamic macromolecules, and a classical way to analyze their inherent flexibility is to perform molecular dynamics simulations. The advantage of using small structural prototypes such as PBs is to give a good approximation of the local structure of the protein backbone. More importantly, by reducing the conformational complexity of protein structures, PBs allow analysis of local protein deformability which cannot be done with other methods and had been used efficiently in different applications. PBxplore is able to process large amounts of data such as those produced by molecular dynamics simulations. It produces frequencies, entropy and information logo outputs as text and graphics.",

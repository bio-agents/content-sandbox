Containing more than 8 billion statements, it federates data from several life-science resources such as PubMed, ChEBI and PubMed. Leveraging the bridges in this linked dataset, we automatically extract associations between compound and biomedical concepts, using literature metadata enrichment. Find more about the method in our preprint here: BioXiv.",

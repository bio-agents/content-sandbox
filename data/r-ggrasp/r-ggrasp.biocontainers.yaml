description: 'Given a group of genomes and their relationship with each other, the
  package clusters the genomes and selects the most representative members of each
  cluster. Additional data can be provided to the prioritize certain genomes. The
  results can be printed out as a list or a new phylogeny with graphs of the trees
  and distance distributions also available. For detailed introduction see: Thomas

      "sc:description": "Probability-based methods for outlier detection in replicated high-throughput biological data.\n\nThis package provides functions for outlier detection in the setting of replicated data. Assuming we have multiple independent measurements (called \"replicates\") for each data point, we can find which sets of measurements are so different from each other that we can call them outliers. We use the absolute difference and coefficient of variation (Zeta, a kind of relative difference) for each pair of replicates to make our determinations.\n\nThe function outlier_DZ returns a numeric identifier for the outlier status ( for non-outlier, for large but not , and for outlier).",

MathML embedded in CellML documents is used to define the underlying mathematics of models. Models consist of a network of reusable components, each with variables and equations giving relationships between those variables. Models may import other models to create systems of increasing complexity. CellML 2.0 is defined by the normative specification presented here, prescribing the CellML syntax and the rules by which it should be used. The normative specification is intended primarily for the developers of software agents which directly consume CellML syntax. Users of CellML models may prefer to browse the informative rendering of the specification (https://cellml.org/specifications/cellml_2.0/) which extends the normative specification with explanations of the rules combined with examples of their usage.",

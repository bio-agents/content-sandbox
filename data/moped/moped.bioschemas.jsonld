      "sc:description": "A Python package for metabolic modelling and topological analysis.\n\nMathematical modeling of metabolic networks is a powerful approach to investigate the underlying principles of metabolism and growth. Such approaches include, amongst others, differential equations based modeling of metabolic systems, constraint based modeling and topological analysis of metabolic networks. Most of these methods are well established and are implemented in numerous software packages, but these are scattered between different programming languages, packages and syntaxes. This complicates establishing straight forward pipelines integrating model construction and simulation",

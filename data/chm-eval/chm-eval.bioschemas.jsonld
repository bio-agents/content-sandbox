  "sc:description": "CHM-eval, aka Syndip, is a benchmark dataset for evaluating the accuracy of small variant callers. It is constructed from the PacBio assemblies of two independent CHM cell lines using procedures largely orthogonal to the methodology used for short-read variant calling, which makes it more comprehensive and less biased in comparison to existing benchmark datasets.",

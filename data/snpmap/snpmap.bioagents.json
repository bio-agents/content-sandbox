                "abstract": "Copyright © 2022 Liu, Yang, Duan, Yu, Wu and Li.New technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have advanced the ability to diagnose diseases and improve prognosis but require the identification of thousands of variants in each report based on several databases scattered across places. Curating an integrated interpretation database is time-consuming, costly, and needs regular update. On the other hand, the automatic curation of knowledge sources always results in overloaded information. In this study, an automated pipeline was proposed to create an integrated visual single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interpretation agent called SNPMap. SNPMap pipelines periodically obtained SNP-related information from LitVar, PubTator, and GWAS Catalog API agents and presented it to the user after extraction, integration, and visualization. Keywords and their semantic relations to each SNP are rendered into two graphs, with their significance represented by the size/width of circles/lines. Moreover, the most related SNPs for each keyword that appeared in SNPMap were calculated and sorted. SNPMap retains the advantage of an automatic process while assisting users in accessing more lucid and detailed information through visualization and integration with other materials.",

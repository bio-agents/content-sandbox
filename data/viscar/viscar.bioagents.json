                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Time-lapse microscopy live-cell imaging is essential for studying the evolution of bacterial communities at single-cell resolution. It allows capturing detailed information about the morphology, gene expression, and spatial characteristics of individual cells at every time instance of the imaging experiment. The image analysis of bacterial \"single-cell movies\" (videos) generates big data in the form of multidimensional time series of measured bacterial attributes. If properly analyzed, these datasets can help us decipher the bacterial communities' growth dynamics and identify the sources and potential functional role of intra- and inter-subpopulation heterogeneity. Recent research has highlighted the importance of investigating the role of biological \"noise\" in gene regulation, cell growth, cell division, etc. Single-cell analytics of complex single-cell movie datasets, capturing the interaction of multiple micro-colonies with thousands of cells, can shed light on essential phenomena for human health, such as the competition of pathogens and benign microbiome cells, the emergence of dormant cells (“persisters”), the formation of biofilms under different stress conditions, etc. However, highly accurate and automated bacterial bioimage analysis and single-cell analytics methods remain elusive, even though they are required before we can routinely exploit the plethora of data that single-cell movies generate. Results: We present visualization and single-cell analytics using R (ViSCAR), a set of methods and corresponding functions, to visually explore and correlate single-cell attributes generated from the image processing of complex bacterial single-cell movies. They can be used to model and visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of attributes at different levels of the microbial community organization (i.e., cell population, colony, generation, etc.), to discover possible epigenetic information transfer across cell generations, infer mathematical and statistical models describing various stochastic phenomena (e.g., cell growth, cell division), and even identify and auto-correct errors introduced unavoidably during the bioimage analysis of a dense movie with thousands of overcrowded cells in the microscope's field of view. Conclusions: ViSCAR empowers researchers to capture and characterize the stochasticity, uncover the mechanisms leading to cellular phenotypes of interest, and decipher a large heterogeneous microbial communities' dynamic behavior.

A graphical pathway representation permits the visualization of the expressed genes in a functional context. Based on the publicly accessible KEGG Ligand database, PathExpress can be adapted to any organism and is currently available for seven Affymetrix genome arrays. About 20% of the probe sets of each array have been assigned to Enzyme Commission numbers by homology relationship and linked to corresponding metabolic pathways.

  annotations. input for the program consists of single or multiple files in gff-format
  which specify the alignment coordinates and annotation features of both sequences.
  output is in format of any size. the features to be displayed are highly customizable
  to meet user specific needs. the program serves to generate print-quality images
  for comparative genome sequence analysis.

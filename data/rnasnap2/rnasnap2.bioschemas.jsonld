      "sc:description": "Single-sequence and profile-based prediction of RNA solvent accessibility using dilated convolutional neural network.\n\n\nRNA solvent accessibility, similar to protein solvent accessibility, reflects the structural regions that are accessible to solvents or other functional biomolecules, and plays an important role for structural and functional characterization. Unlike protein solvent accessibility, only a few agents are available for predicting RNA solvent accessibility despite the fact that millions of RNA transcripts have unknown structures and functions. Also, these agents have limited accuracy. Here, we have developed RNAsnap2 that employs a dilated convolutional neural network (Figure 1) with a new feature, based on predicted base-pairing probabilities from LinearPartition[4].",

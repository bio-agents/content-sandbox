description: This is a package that includes pre-processing and quality control functions
  that can remove margin events, compensate and transform the data and that will use
  PeacoQCSignalStability for quality control. This last function will first detect
  peaks in each channel of the flowframe. It will remove anomalies based on the IsolationTree
  function and the MAD outlier detection method. This package can be used for both
  flow- and mass cytometry data.

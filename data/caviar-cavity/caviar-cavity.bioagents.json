    "description": "Cavity Identification And Rationalization (CAVIAR) is a method for automatic cavity detection, description and decomposition into subcavities. CAVIAR is an open source agent for protein cavity identification and rationalization, written in python and available as command line and as a GUI. It comprises a subcavity segmentation algorithm that produces meaningful decomposition of cavities, fully focused on the protein structure and agnostic of any ligand information. These subcavities reproduce subpockets as defined empirically with medicinal chemistry knowledge.",

This work describes CAVIAR, a new open source agent for generating descriptors for binding sites, using protein structures in PDB and mmCIF format as well as trajectory frames from molecular dynamics simulations as input. The applicability of CAVIAR descriptors is showcased by computing machine learning predictions of binding site ligandability. The method can also automatically assign subcavities, even in the absence of a bound ligand. The defined subpockets mimic the empirical definitions used in medicinal chemistry projects. It is shown that the experimental binding affinity scales relatively well with the number of subcavities filled by the ligand, with compounds binding to more than three subcavities having nanomolar or better affinities to the target. The CAVIAR descriptors and methods can be used in any machine learning-based investigations of problems involving binding sites, from protein engineering to hit identification. The full software code is available on GitHub and a conda package is hosted on Anaconda cloud.",

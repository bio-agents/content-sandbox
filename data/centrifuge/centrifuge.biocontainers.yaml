description: A very rapid and memory-efficient system for the classification of dna
  sequences from microbial samples. the system uses a novel indexing scheme based
  on the burrows-wheeler transform and the ferragina-manzini index, optimized specifically
  for the metagenomic classification problem. together these advances enable timely
  and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers.

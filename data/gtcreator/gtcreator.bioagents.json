To assess performance of polyp detection methods in colonoscopy videos, clinicians have to deal with the annotation of thousands of images. Current existing agents could be improved in terms of flexibility and ease of use. Methods:: We introduce GTCreator, a flexible annotation agent for providing image and text annotations to image-based datasets. It keeps the main basic functionalities of other similar agents while extending other capabilities such as allowing multiple annotators to work simultaneously on the same task or enhanced dataset browsing and easy annotation transfer aiming to speed up annotation processes in large datasets. Results:: The comparison with other similar agents shows that GTCreator allows to obtain fast and precise annotation of image datasets, being the only one which offers full annotation editing and browsing capabilites. Conclusion:: Our proposed annotation agent has been proven to be efficient for large image dataset annotation, as well as showing potential of use in other stages of method evaluation such as experimental setup or results analysis.",

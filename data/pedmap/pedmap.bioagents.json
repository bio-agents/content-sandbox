In this study, a pediatric disease epidemiology knowledgebase called PedMap (http://pedmap.nbscn.org) was constructed from the clinical data from 5 447 202 outpatient visits of 2 189 868 unique patients at a children’s hospital (Hangzhou, China) from 2013 to 2016. The top 100 most-reported pediatric diseases were identified and visualized. These common pediatric diseases were clustered into 4 age groups and 4 seasons. The prevalence, age distribution and co-occurrence diseases for each disease were also visualized. Furthermore, an online prediction agent based on Gaussian regression models was developed to predict pediatric disease incidence based on weather information. PedMap is the first comprehensive epidemiological resource to show the full view of age-related, seasonal, climate-related variations in and co-occurrence patterns of pediatric diseases.",

      "sc:description": "EASAL is a agent for  efficient atlasing, analysis and search of molecular sssembly landscapes. It is a geometric methodology for analyzing free energy and kinetics of assembly driven by short-range pair-potentials in an implicit solvent and provides a proof-of-concept illustration of its unique capabilities. An atlas is a labeled partition of the assembly landscape into a roadmap of maximal, contiguous, nearly-equipotential-energy conformational regions or macrostates, together with their neighborhood relationships. The new methodology decouples the roadmap generation from sampling and produces: (1) a queryable atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin structure, energy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of basins, each path being a sequence of conformational regions or macrostates below a desired energy threshold; and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes (configurational entropy), and path probabilities",

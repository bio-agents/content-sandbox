                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Protein binding events on RNA are highly related to RNA secondary structure, which affects post-transcriptional regulation and translation. However, it remains challenging to describe the association between RNA secondary structure and protein binding events. Here, we present Structure Motif Analysis agent (SMAagent), a pipeline that integrates RNA secondary structure and protein binding site information to profile the binding structure preference of each protein. As an example of applying SMAagent, we extracted the RNA-structure and binding site information respectively from the DMS-seq and eCLIP-seq data of the K562 cell-line, and used SMAagent to analyze the structure motif of each RNA binding protein (RBP). This new approach provided results consistent with X-ray crystallography data from the protein data bank (PDB) database, demonstrating that it can help researchers investigate the structure preference of RBP, and understand the role of RNA secondary structure in gene expression.

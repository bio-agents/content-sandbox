      "sc:description": "A simulation framework for gene drive systems incorporating seasonality and epidemiological dynamics.\n\nMGDrivE2: Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2.\n\nMGDrivE 2 is a new simulation platform which extends capabilities from the MGDrivE simulation package in a new mathematical and computational framework. For more information about MGDrivE, see our publication. Some of the notable capabilities of MGDrivE 2 include incorporation of human populations, epidemiological dynamics, time-varying parameters, and a continuous-time simulation framework with various sampling algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic interpretations.",

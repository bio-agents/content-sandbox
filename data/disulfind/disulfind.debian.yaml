description: '''disulfinder'' is for predicting the disulfide bonding state of cysteines
  and their disulfide connectivity starting from sequence alone. Disulfide bridges
  play a major role in the stabilization of the folding process for several proteins.
  Prediction of disulfide bridges from sequence alone is therefore useful for the
  study of structural and functional properties of specific proteins. In addition,
  knowledge about the disulfide bonding state of cysteines may help the experimental
  structure determination process and may be useful in other genomic annotation tasks.
  . ''disulfinder'' predicts disulfide patterns in two computational stages: (1) the
  disulfide bonding state of each cysteine is predicted by a BRNN-SVM binary classifier;
  (2) cysteines that are known to participate in the formation of bridges are paired
  by a Recursive Neural Network to obtain a connectivity pattern.'

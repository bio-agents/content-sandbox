Agents implementing such approach are a powerful way to gain biological insights related to their samples, provided that biologists/clinicians have access to computational solutions even when they have little programming experience or bioinformatics support. To achieve this goal, we designed ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment), a unified online research service that provides end-users with a set of agents to interpret their proteomics data in a collaborative and reproducible manner. ProteoRE is built upon the Galaxy framework, a workflow system allowing for data and analysis persistence, and providing user interfaces to facilitate the interaction with agents dedicated to the functional and the visual analysis of proteomics datasets. A set of agents relying on computational methods selected for their complementarity in terms of functional analysis was developed and made accessible via the ProteoRE web portal. In this chapter, a step-by-step protocol linking these agents is designed to perform a functional annotation and GO-based enrichment analyses applied to a set of differentially expressed proteins as a use case. Analytical practices, guidelines as well as tips related to this strategy are also provided. Agents, datasets, and results are freely available at http://www.proteore.org, allowing researchers to reuse them.",

To achieve this goal, we designed a set of agents under the Galaxy framework to allow biologists to define their own strategy for reproducible biomarker selection. These agents rely on retrieving experimental data from public databases, and applying successive filters derived from information relating to disease pathophysiology. A step-by-step protocol linking these agents was implemented to select tissue-leakage biomarker candidates of myocardial infarction. A list of 24 candidates suitable for experimental assessment by MS-based proteomics is proposed. These agents have been made publicly available at http://www.proteore.org, allowing researchers to reuse them in their quest for biomarker discovery.",

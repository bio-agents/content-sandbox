    "description": "A Bioconductor and Shiny app to query protein expression patterns in the Human Protein Atlas.\n\nHPAStainR package to be submitted to Bioconductor.\n\nHPAStain.R is an R package/Shiny app used to query the Human Protein Atlas for staining data. The purpose of this agent is to test if a list of proteins/genes is associated with a certain cell type in a HPA tested tissue. E.g. you have a list of protein coding genes from a differential expression single cell analysis and want to see if these proteins are associated with a known cell type. Instead of querying HPA multiple times you can load your list in HPAStainR which will return a ranked table of the cell types with the most protein staining.",

It is an excellent resource of tissue and cell type protein localization, but only allows the query of a single protein at a time. We introduce HPAStainR as a new Shiny app and Bioconductor/R package used to query the scored staining patterns in the Human Protein Atlas with multiple proteins/genes of interest. This allows the user to determine if an experimentally-generated protein/gene list associates with a particular cell type. We validated the agent using the Panglao Database cell type specific marker genes and a Genotype Expression (GTEx) tissue deconvolution dataset. HPAStainR identified 92% of the Panglao cell types in the top quartile of confidence scores limited to tissue type of origin results. It also appropriately identified the correct cell types from the GTEx dataset. HPAStainR fills a gap in available bioinformatics agents to identify cell type protein expression patterns and can assist in establishing ground truths and exploratory analysis. HPAStainR is available from: https://32tim32.shinyapps.io/HPAStainR/",

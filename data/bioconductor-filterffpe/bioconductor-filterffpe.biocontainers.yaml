description: This package finds and filters artificial chimeric reads specifically
  generated in next-generation sequencing (NGS) process of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  (FFPE) tissues. These artificial chimeric reads can lead to a large number of false
  positive structural variation (SV) calls. The required input is an indexed BAM file
  of a FFPE sample.

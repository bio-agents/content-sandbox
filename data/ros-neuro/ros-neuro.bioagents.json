                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Tonin, Beraldo, Tortora and Menegatti.The growing interest in neurorobotics has led to a proliferation of heterogeneous neurophysiological-based applications controlling a variety of robotic devices. Although recent years have seen great advances in this technology, the integration between human neural interfaces and robotics is still limited, making evident the necessity of creating a standardized research framework bridging the gap between neuroscience and robotics. This perspective paper presents Robot Operating System (ROS)-Neuro, an open-source framework for neurorobotic applications based on ROS. ROS-Neuro aims to facilitate the software distribution, the repeatability of the experimental results, and support the birth of a new community focused on neuro-driven robotics. In addition, the exploitation of Robot Operating System (ROS) infrastructure guarantees stability, reliability, and robustness, which represent fundamental aspects to enhance the translational impact of this technology. We suggest that ROS-Neuro might be the future development platform for the flourishing of a new generation of neurorobots to promote the rehabilitation, the inclusion, and the independence of people with disabilities in their everyday life.",

    "description": "CNApp is a user-friendly web agent that offers sample- and cohort-level association analyses, allowing a comprehensive and integrative exploration of CNAs with clinical and molecular variables. CNApp generates genome-wide profiles with tumor-purity correctiion, calculates CNA levels by computing broad, focal and global CNA scores (BCS, FCS and GCS, respectively), identifies CNAs associated with clinical features and molecular annotated variables and uses machine learning-based predictions to classify samples by using segmented data from either microarrays or next-generation sequencing. CNApp provides a unique scenario to comprehensively analyze CNAs and integrate them with molecular and clinical features.",

All rights reserved.Somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) are a hallmark of cancer, but their role in tumorigenesis and clinical relevance remain largely unclear. Here we developed CNApp, a web-based agent that allows a comprehensive exploration of CNAs by using purity-corrected segmented data from multiple genomic platforms. CNApp generates genome-wide profiles, computes CNA scores for broad, focal and global CNA burdens, and uses machine learning-based predictions to classify samples. We applied CNApp to the TCGA pan-cancer dataset of 10,635 genomes showing that CNAs classify cancer types according to their tissue-of-origin, and that each cancer type shows specific ranges of broad and focal CNA scores. Moreover, CNApp reproduces recurrent CNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predicts colon cancer molecular subtypes and microsatellite instability based on broad CNA scores and discrete genomic imbalances. In summary, CNApp facilitates CNA-driven research by providing a unique framework to identify relevant clinical implications. CNApp is hosted at https://agents.idibaps.org/CNApp/.",

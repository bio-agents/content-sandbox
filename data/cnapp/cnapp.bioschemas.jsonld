      "sc:description": "CNApp is a user-friendly web agent that offers sample- and cohort-level association analyses, allowing a comprehensive and integrative exploration of CNAs with clinical and molecular variables. CNApp generates genome-wide profiles with tumor-purity correctiion, calculates CNA levels by computing broad, focal and global CNA scores (BCS, FCS and GCS, respectively), identifies CNAs associated with clinical features and molecular annotated variables and uses machine learning-based predictions to classify samples by using segmented data from either microarrays or next-generation sequencing. CNApp provides a unique scenario to comprehensively analyze CNAs and integrate them with molecular and clinical features.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DNA metabarcoding offers new perspectives in biodiversity research. This recently developed approach to ecosystem study relies heavily on the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and thus calls upon the ability to deal with huge sequence data sets. The obiagents package satisfies this requirement thanks to a set of programs specifically designed for analysing NGS data in a DNA metabarcoding context. Their capacity to filter and edit sequences while taking into account taxonomic annotation helps to set up tailor-made analysis pipelines for a broad range of DNA metabarcoding applications, including biodiversity surveys or diet analyses. The obiagents package is distributed as an open source software available on the following website: http://metabarcoding.org/obiagents. A Galaxy wrapper is available on the GenOuest core facility agentshed: http://agentshed.genouest.org.",

All rights reserved.Protein-carbohydrate interactions are crucial for many cellular processes but can be challenging to biologically characterise. To improve our understanding and ability to model these molecular interactions, we used a carefully curated set of 370 protein-carbohydrate complexes with experimental structural and biophysical data in order to train and validate a new agent, cutoff scanning matrix (CSM)-carbohydrate, using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict their binding affinity and rank docking poses as a scoring function. Information on both protein and carbohydrate complementarity, in terms of shape and chemistry, was captured using graph-based structural signatures. Across both training and independent test sets, we achieved comparable Pearson’s correlations of 0.72 under cross-validation [root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.58 Kcal/mol] and 0.67 on the independent test (RMSE of 1.72 Kcal/mol), providing confidence in the generalisability and robustness of the final model. Similar performance was obtained across mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, further highlighting the applicability of this approach to the study of larger complexes. We show CSM-carbohydrate significantly outperformed previous approaches and have implemented our method and make all data freely available through both a user-friendly web interface and application programming interface, to facilitate programmatic access at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/csm_carbohydrate/. We believe CSM-carbohydrate will be an invaluable agent for helping assess docking poses and the effects of mutations on protein-carbohydrate affinity, unravelling important aspects that drive binding recognition.",

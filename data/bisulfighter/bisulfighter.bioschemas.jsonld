Compared with other published agents, it provides greater sensitivity for mCs with fewer false positives, more precise estimates of mC levels, more exact locations of DMRs, and better agreement of DMRs with differentially expressed genes. The superior accuracy is maintained under various sequencing depths and tissue types.",

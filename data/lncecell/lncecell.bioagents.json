Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Within the tumour microenvironment, cells exhibit different behaviours driven by fine-tuning of gene regulation. Identification of cellular-specific gene regulatory networks will deepen the understanding of disease pathology at single-cell resolution and contribute to the development of precision medicine. Here, we describe a database, LnCeCell (http://www.bio-bigdata.net/LnCeCell/ or http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LnCeCell/), which aims to document cellular-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks for personalised characterisation of diseases based on the 'One Cell, One World' theory. LnCeCell is curated with cellular-specific ceRNA regulations from >94 000 cells across 25 types of cancers and provides >9000 experimentally supported lncRNA biomarkers, associated with tumour metastasis, recurrence, prognosis, circulation, drug resistance, etc. For each cell, LnCeCell illustrates a global map of ceRNA sub-cellular locations, which have been manually curated from the literature and related data sources, and portrays a functional state atlas for a single cancer cell. LnCeCell also provides several flexible agents to infer ceRNA functions based on a specific cellular background. LnCeCell serves as an important resource for investigating the gene regulatory networks within a single cell and can help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying complex microbial ecosystems and individual phenotypes.",

Theoretically, patterns and factors that affect the codon usage of viruses should reflect evolutionary changes that allow them to optimize their codon usage to their hosts. Some software agents can analyze the codon usage of organisms; however, their performance has room for improvement, as these agents do not focus on examining the codon usage co-adaptation between viruses and their hosts. This paper describes the vhcub R package, which is a crucial agent used to analyze the co-adaptation of codon usage between a virus and its host, with several implementations of indices and plots. The agent is available from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vhcub/.",

The archived Software version is available here.\n\nGCATSL is a deep learning model that can be used for SL prediction. As shown in the following flowchart (a), GCATSL first learns representations for nodes based on different feature graphs together with a known SL interaction graph, and then uses the learned node representations to reconstruct SL interaction matrix for SL prediction.",

    "description": "Click-ExM is a agent, which integrates click labeling into Expansion microscopy (ExM) to enable a ‘one-stop-shop’ method for nanoscale imaging of various types of biomolecule. By click labeling with biotin and staining with fluorescently labeled streptavidin, a large range of biomolecules can be imaged by the standard ExM procedure normally used for proteins.",

                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.Expansion microscopy (ExM) allows super-resolution imaging on conventional fluorescence microscopes, but has been limited to proteins and nucleic acids. Here we develop click-ExM, which integrates click labeling into ExM to enable a ‘one-stop-shop’ method for nanoscale imaging of various types of biomolecule. By click labeling with biotin and staining with fluorescently labeled streptavidin, a large range of biomolecules can be imaged by the standard ExM procedure normally used for proteins. Using 18 clickable labels, we demonstrate click-ExM on lipids, glycans, proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules. We demonstrate that click-ExM is applicable in cell culture systems and for tissue imaging. We further show that click-ExM is compatible with signal-amplification techniques and two-color imaging. Click-ExM thus provides a convenient and versatile method for super-resolution imaging, which may be routinely used for cell and tissue samples.",

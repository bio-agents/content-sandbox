      "sc:description": "Stand-alone software agent for variant matching.\n\nVarWatch is a agent for professional human geneticists, genetic counselors and researchers working with genetic data from patients. High-throughput sequencing is uncovering an increasing number of genomic variants with a suspected link to an observed clinical phenotype. However, substantiating the clinical relevance of these variants-of-unknown-significance (VUS) typically requires one or more independent observations. VarWatch offers a non-commercial platform where such VUS can be registered to be continuously monitored for similar findings in external databases or the VarWatch register itself. Potential matches to other case descriptions will be forwarded to the variant owners to aid in the finding of a diagnosis for the affected patient(s).",

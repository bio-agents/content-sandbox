Pandoc scholar offers simple ways to include metadata on authors, affiliations, contact details, and citations. The data is included into the final output as document headers. Additionally all entries can be exported as JSON-LD, a standardized format for the semantic web.\n\nPandoc a universal document converter.\n\nCreate beautiful, semantically enriched articles with pandoc.\n\nIf you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife.\n\n(← = conversion from; → = conversion to; ↔︎ = conversion from and to).",

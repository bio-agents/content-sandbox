description: Designed to determine features (be it operational taxanomic unit (otu),
  species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple
  samples. it is designed to address the effects of both normalization and under-sampling
  of microbial communities on disease association detection and the testing of feature
  correlations.

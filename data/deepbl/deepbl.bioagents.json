    "description": "DeepBL is a deep learning-based approach for beta-lactamase classification using protein or genome sequence data. DeepBL is a high-throughput and deep learning-based multi-class classifier, to accurately identify beta-lactamase classes by incorporating sequence-derived features. DeepBL was implemented based on the Small VGGNet architecture and using the TensorFlow deep learning library. We evaluated DeepBL on carefully prepared benchmark and independent test datasets and the results of the 10-fold cross-validation and independent test demonstrate DeepBL’s robustness and generalization.",

For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Beta-lactamases (BLs) are enzymes localized in the periplasmic space of bacterial pathogens, where they confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Experimental identification of BLs is costly yet crucial to understand beta-lactam resistance mechanisms. To address this issue, we present DeepBL, a deep learning-based approach by incorporating sequence-derived features to enable high-throughput prediction of BLs. Specifically, DeepBL is implemented based on the Small VGGNet architecture and the TensorFlow deep learning library. Furthermore, the performance of DeepBL models is investigated in relation to the sequence redundancy level and negative sample selection in the benchmark dataset. The models are trained on datasets of varying sequence redundancy thresholds, and the model performance is evaluated by extensive benchmarking tests. Using the optimized DeepBL model, we perform proteome-wide screening for all reviewed bacterium protein sequences available from the UniProt database.

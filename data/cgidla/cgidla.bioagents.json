                "abstract": "Â© 2004-2012 IEEE.It is well known that CpG island plays an important role in gene methylation. Since CpG island is closely related to human genetic characteristics such as TATA-box, tissue expression specificity, and LAUPs (Lineage-associated Underrepresented Permutations), it is important to investigate the sequence specificity of CpG island as well as the potential genetic characteristics related to CpG island to further understand the methylation related regulation mechanism. Therefore, this study develops such an online service website for CpG island related density and LAUPs analysis (CGIDLA, www.combio-lezhang.online/cgidla/index.html), that not only can investigate the relationship among the CpG island density, TATA-box feature, and expression breadth of human genes, but also deposit LAUPs of 32 representative species to help molecular biologists investigate the relationship between CpG island and LUAPs. Moreover, CGIDLA provides the source code download service and the related LAUPs counting functions.",

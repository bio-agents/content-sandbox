Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Japanese Radiation Research Society and Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology.The particle irradiation data ensemble (PIDE) is the largest database of cell survival data measured after exposure to ion beams and photon reference radiation. We report here on the updated version of the PIDE database and demonstrate how to investigate generic properties of radiation dose response using these sets of raw data. The database now contains information of over 1100 pairs of photon and ion dose response curves. It provides the originally published raw data of cell survival in addition to given linear quadratic (LQ) model parameters. If available, the raw data were used to derive LQ model parameters in the same way for all experiments. To demonstrate the extent of the database and the variability among experiments we focus on the dose response curves after ion and photon radiation separately in a first step. Furthermore, we discuss the capability and the limitations of the database for analyzing properties of low and high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation response based on multiple experiments. PIDE is freely available to the research community under www.gsi.de/bio-pide.",

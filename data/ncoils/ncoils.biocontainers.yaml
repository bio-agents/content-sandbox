description: Program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel two-stranded
  coiled-coils and derives a similarity score. by comparing this score to the distribution
  of scores in globular and coiled-coil proteins, the program then calculates the
  probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil conformation.

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 by The American Society of HematologyRHD and RHCE genes encode Rh blood group antigens and exhibit extensive single-nucleotide polymorphisms and chromosome structural changes in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). RH variation can drive loss of antigen epitopes or expression of new epitopes, predisposing patients with SCD to Rh alloimmunization. Serologic antigen typing is limited to common Rh antigens, necessitating a genetic approach to detect variant antigen expression. We developed a novel algorithm termed RHtyper for RH genotyping from existing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. RHtyper determined RH genotypes in an average of 3.4 and 3.3 minutes per sample for RHD and RHCE, respectively. In a validation cohort consisting of 57 patients with SCD, RHtyper achieved 100% accuracy for RHD and 98.2% accuracy for RHCE, when compared with genotypes obtained by RH BeadChip and targeted molecular assays and after verification by Sanger sequencing and independent next-generation sequencing assays. RHtyper was next applied to WGS data from an additional 827 patients with SCD. In the total cohort of 884 patients, RHtyper identified 38 RHD and 28 RHCE distinct alleles, including a novel RHD DAU allele, RHD* 602G, 733C, 744T 1136T. RHtyper provides comprehensive and high-throughput RH genotyping from WGS data, facilitating deconvolution of the extensive RH genetic variation among patients with SCD. We have implemented RHtyper as a cloud-based public access application in DNAnexus (https://platform.dnanexus.com/app/RHtyper), enabling clinicians and researchers to perform RH genotyping with next-generation sequencing data.",

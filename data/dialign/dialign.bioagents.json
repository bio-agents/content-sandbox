In recent years, various versions of the program have been developed, some of which are fully automated, whereas others are able to accept user-specified external information. In this article, we review some versions of the program that are available through 'GÃ¶ttingen Bioinformatics Compute Server'. In addition to previously described implementations, we present a new release of DIALIGN called 'DIALIGN-PFAM', which uses hits to the PFAM database for improved protein alignment. Our software is available through http://dialign.gobics.de/.",

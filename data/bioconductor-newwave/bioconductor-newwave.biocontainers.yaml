description: A model designed for dimensionality reduction and batch effect removal
  for scRNA-seq data. It is designed to be massively parallelizable using shared objects
  that prevent memory duplication, and it can be used with different mini-batch approaches
  in order to reduce time consumption. It assumes a negative binomial distribution
  for the data with a dispersion parameter that can be both commonwise across gene
  both genewise.

    "description": "Understanding suppression of HIV in R.\n\nAnalyzes longitudinal data of HIV decline in patients on antiretroviral therapy using the canonical biphasic exponential decay model (pioneered, for example, by work in Perelson et al. (1997) <doi:10.1038/387188a0>; and Wu and Ding (1999) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00410.x>). Model fitting and parameter estimation are performed, with additional options to calculate the time to viral suppression. Plotting and summary agents are also provided for fast assessment of model results.\n\nushr is an open-source R package that models the decline of HIV during ART using a popular mathematical framework.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: HIV/AIDS is responsible for the deaths of one million people every year. Although mathematical modeling has provided many insights into the dynamics of HIV infection, there is still a lack of accessible agents for researchers unfamiliar with modeling techniques to apply them to their own clinical data. Results: Here we present ushr, a free and open-source R package that models the decline of HIV during antiretroviral treatment (ART) using a popular mathematical framework. ushr can be applied to longitudinal data of viral load measurements, and provides processing agents to prepare it for computational analysis. By mathematically fitting the data, important biological parameters can then be estimated, including the lifespans of short and long-lived infected cells, and the time to reach viral suppression below a defined detection threshold. The package also provides visualization and summary agents for fast assessment of model results. Conclusions: ushr enables researchers without a strong mathematical or computational background to model the dynamics of HIV using longitudinal clinical data. Increasing accessibility to such methods may facilitate quantitative analysis across a broader range of independent studies, so that greater insights on HIV infection and treatment dynamics may be gained.",

description: The name of the miRsponge package has been changed into "miRspongeR".
  Future updates will be seen in the miRspongeR package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRspongeR/).
  This package provides several functions to study miRNA sponge (also called ceRNA
  or miRNA decoy), including popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions,
  and the integrative method to integrate miRNA sponge interactions from different
  methods, as well as the functions to validate miRNA sponge interactions, and infer
  miRNA sponge modules, conduct enrichment analysis of modules, and conduct survival
  analysis of modules.

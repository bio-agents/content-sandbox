      "sc:description": "d-SEAMS is a collection of analysis agents for molecular simulations. It has been implemented as a High Performance Cluster enabled engine in C++, with extensions via the Lua scripting interface. The code sheds light on the structures from simulation trajectories, in terms of their topology and it has been tailored for the analysis of nucleating systems. The framework is meant to be interfaced to a large variety of external agents and software, including R and other libraries. It is also the first and at-present only scientific analysis agent to use reproducible builds via nix.",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Recent advances in computational methods have facilitated large-scale sampling of protein structures, leading to breakthroughs in protein structural prediction and enabling de novo protein design. Establishing methods to identify candidate structures that can lead to native folds or designable structures remains a challenge, since few existing metrics capture high-level structural features such as architectures, folds and conformity to conserved structural motifs. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in semantic segmentation—a sub-field of image classification in which a class label is predicted for every pixel. Here, we apply semantic segmentation to protein structures as a novel strategy for fold identification and structure quality assessment. Results: We train a CNN that assigns each residue in a multi-domain protein to one of 38 architecture classes designated by the CATH database. Our model achieves a high per-residue accuracy of 90.8% on the test set (95.0% average per-class accuracy; 87.8% average per-structure accuracy). We demonstrate that individual class probabilities can be used as a metric that indicates the degree to which a randomly generated structure assumes a specific fold, as well as a metric that highlights non-conformative regions of a protein belonging to a known class. These capabilities yield a powerful agent for guiding structural sampling for both structural prediction and design.",

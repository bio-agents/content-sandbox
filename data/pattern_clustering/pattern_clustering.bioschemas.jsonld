  "sc:description": "Pattern clustering is a agent to cluster a set of DNA patterns onto smaller and more representative set of DNA patterns.Most pattern enumeration agents, such as POCO, report patterns overlapping. Therefore after discovering a set of statistically significant nucleotide patterns, it is useful to cluster the overlapping patterns into representative patterns.",

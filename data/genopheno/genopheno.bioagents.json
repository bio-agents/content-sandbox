Published by Oxford University Press.Precision medicine promises to revolutionize treatment, shifting therapeutic approaches from the classical one-size-fits-all to those more tailored to the patient's individual genomic profile, lifestyle and environmental exposures. Yet, to advance precision medicine's main objective-ensuring the optimum diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for each individual-investigators need access to large-scale clinical and genomic data repositories. Despite the vast proliferation of these datasets, locating and obtaining access to many remains a challenge. We sought to provide an overview of available patient-level datasets that contain both genotypic data, obtained by next-generation sequencing, and phenotypic data- A nd to create a dynamic, online catalog for consultation, contribution and revision by the research community. Datasets included in this review conform to six specific inclusion parameters that are: (i) contain data from more than 500 human subjects; (ii) contain both genotypic and phenotypic data from the same subjects; (iii) include whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing data; (iv) include at least 100 recorded phenotypic variables per subject; (v) accessible through a website or collaboration with investigators and (vi) make access information available in English. Using these criteria, we identified 30 datasets, reviewed them and provided results in the release version of a catalog, which is publicly available through a dynamic Web application and on GitHub. Users can review as well as contribute new datasets for inclusion (Web: Https://avillachlab.shinyapps.io/genophenocatalog/; GitHub: Https://github.com/hms-dbmi/GenoPheno-CatalogShiny).",

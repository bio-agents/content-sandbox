It features advanced matrix matching algorithms implemented in C++ that can be used to scan hundreds of matrices against chromosome-sized sequences in few seconds. MOODS can also process high-order PWMs with dependencies between adjacent positions and sequence variants such as SNPs, insertions and deletions.",

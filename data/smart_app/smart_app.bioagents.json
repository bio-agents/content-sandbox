However, existing web applications for DNA methylation analysis does not adequately address the need of experimental biologists, and many additional functions are often required. Results: To facilitate DNA methylation analysis, we present the SMART (Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Agent) App, a user-friendly and easy-to-use web application for comprehensively analyzing the DNA methylation data of TCGA project. The SMART App integrates multi-omics and clinical data with DNA methylation and provides key interactive and customized functions including CpG visualization, pan-cancer methylation profile, differential methylation analysis, correlation analysis and survival analysis for users to analyze the DNA methylation in diverse cancer types in a multi-dimensional manner. Conclusion: The SMART App serves as a new approach for users, especially wet-bench scientists with no programming background, to analyze the scientific big data and facilitate data mining. The SMART App is available at http://www.bioinfo-zs.com/smartapp.",

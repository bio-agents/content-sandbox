For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Biological network-based strategies are useful in prioritizing genes associated with diseases. Several comprehensive human gene networks such as STRING, GIANT and HumanNet were developed and used in network-assisted algorithms to identify disease-associated genes. However, none of these networks are disease-specific and may not accurately reflect gene interactions for a specific disease. Aiming to improve disease gene prioritization using networks, we propose a Disease-Specific Network Enhancement Prioritization (DiSNEP) framework. DiSNEP first enhances a comprehensive gene network specifically for a disease through a diffusion process on a gene-gene similarity matrix derived from disease omics data. The enhanced disease-specific gene network thus better reflects true gene interactions for the disease and may improve prioritizing disease-associated genes subsequently. In simulations, DiSNEP that uses an enhanced disease-specific network prioritizes more true signal genes than comparison methods using a general gene network or without prioritization. Applications to prioritize cancer-associated gene expression and DNA methylation signal genes for five cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project suggest that more prioritized candidate genes by DiSNEP are cancer-related according to the DisGeNET database than those prioritized by the comparison methods, consistently across all five cancer types considered, and for both gene expression and DNA methylation signal genes.",

      "sc:description": "CoBRA is a comprehensive ChIP/ATAC‐seq analysis agent built using snakemake and Docker which allows for escalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows.\n\nCoBRA combines the use of several dozen ChIP/ATAC‐seq agents, suites, and packages to create a complete pipeline that takes ChIP/ATAC‐seq analysis from unsupervised analyses, differential peak calling, and downstream pathway analysis. In addition, CoBRA has been outfitted with several recently published agents that allow for better normalziation and CNV correction. The results are compiled in a simple and highly visual report containing the key figures to explain the analysis, and then compiles all of the relevant files, tables, and pictures into an easy to navigate folder.",

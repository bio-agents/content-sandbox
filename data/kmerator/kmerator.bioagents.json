    "description": "Kmerator is a prototype agent designed for the prediction of specific k-mers (also called tags) from input sequences, considering a reference genome and an ENSEMBL-like transcriptome. From these specific k-mers, it also outputs their corresponding specific contigs which are sequences of consecutive k-mers (overlapping length between k-mers must be k-1, otherwise, it's a new contig). Kmerator first uses Jellyfish to create 2 requestable indexes from the reference genome and transcriptome, and second, decomposes your input transcript or gene sequences to count the occurences of each k-mer in the genome and transcriptome.",

                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics.The huge body of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries is a treasure of functional information allowing to quantify the expression of known or novel transcripts in tissues. However, transcript quantification commonly relies on alignment methods requiring a lot of computational resources and processing time, which does not scale easily to large datasets. K-mer decomposition constitutes a new way to process RNA-seq data for the identification of transcriptional signatures, as k-mers can be used to quantify accurately gene expression in a less resource-consuming way. We present the Kmerator Suite, a set of three agents designed to extract specific k-mer signatures, quantify these k-mers into RNA-seq datasets and quickly visualize large dataset characteristics. The core agent, Kmerator, produces specific k-mers for 97% of human genes, enabling the measure of gene expression with high accuracy in simulated datasets. KmerExploR, a direct application of Kmerator, uses a set of predictor gene-specific k-mers to infer metadata including library protocol, sample features or contaminations from RNA-seq datasets. KmerExploR results are visualized through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Kmerator Suite can be used for advanced queries targeting known or new biomarkers such as mutations, gene fusions or long non-coding RNAs for human health applications.",

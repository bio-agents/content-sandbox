description: This package aims at making rna-sequencing (rna-seq) data more comparable
  to microarray data. the comparability is achieved by summarizing sequencing-based
  expressions of probe regions using a modified version of rma algorithm. the pipeline
  takes mapped reads in bam format as an input and produces either gene expressions
  or original microarray probe set expressions as an output.

The predictions can be used by policymakers to determine whether current policies should be strengthened/mitigated or new policies should be challenged to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Although vaccines have been mitigating the pandemic initially, the recent resurgence with new variants has been observed in many vaccinated countries. This paper shows how to use deathdaily to detect symptoms of resurgence. The proposed deathdaily is available in public and can be installed by a Python package manager PyPI. The deathdaily has been downloaded by 15,964 users worldwide, according to https://pepy.tech/project/deathdaily. The fact shows that the applicability, practicality, and usefulness of the proposed program have been duly evaluated.",

Existing works perform multi-scale feature aggregation in an inter-layer manner, namely inter-layer feature aggregation. However, such an approach only fuses features at either a lower scale or a higher scale, which may result in a limited segmentation performance, especially on thin vessels. This discovery motivates us to fuse multi-scale features in each layer, intra-layer feature aggregation, to mitigate the problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Pyramid-Net for accurate retinal vessel segmentation, which features intra-layer pyramid-scale aggregation blocks (IPABs). At each layer, IPABs generate two associated branches at a higher scale and a lower scale, respectively, and the two with the main branch at the current scale operate in a pyramid-scale manner. Three further enhancements including pyramid inputs enhancement, deep pyramid supervision, and pyramid skip connections are proposed to boost the performance. We have evaluated Pyramid-Net on three public retinal fundus photography datasets (DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1). The experimental results show that Pyramid-Net can effectively improve the segmentation performance especially on thin vessels, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on all the adopted three datasets. In addition, our method is more efficient than existing methods with a large reduction in computational cost. We have released the source code at https://github.com/JerRuy/Pyramid-Net.",

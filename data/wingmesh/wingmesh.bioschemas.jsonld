      "sc:description": "A Matlab-Based Application for Finite Element Modeling of Insect Wings.\n\nManual modeling of complicated insect wings presents considerable practical challenges. To overcome these challenges, therefore, we developed WingMesh. This is an application for simple yet precise automatic modeling of insect wings. Using a series of examples, we showed the performance of our application in practice. We expect WingMesh to be particularly useful in comparative studies, especially where the modeling of a large number of insect wings is required within a short time.",

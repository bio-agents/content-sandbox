description: Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers  that
  can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are  available
  for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters  and factors as
  well as many elementwise and summary functions. Many fast  algorithmic operations
  such as 'match' and 'order' support interactive data exploration and manipulation
  and optionally leverage caching.

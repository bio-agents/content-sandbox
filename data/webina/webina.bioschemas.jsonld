      "sc:description": "An Open-Source Library and Web App that Runs AutoDock Vina Entirely in the Web Browser.\n\n1 Abstract Molecular docking is a computational technique for predicting how a small molecule might bind a macromolecular target. Among docking programs, AutoDock Vina is particularly popular. Like many docking programs, Vina requires users to download install an executable file and to run that file from a Unix- or DOS-like command-line interface. Choosing proper configuration parameters and analyzing Vina output is also sometimes challenging. These issues are particularly problematic for students and novice researchers. We have created Webina, a new version of Vina, to address these challenges. Webina is a JavaScript WebAssembly library that runs AutoDock Vina entirely in a web browser. To use Webina, users need only visit a Webina-enabled webpage. The docking calculations take place on the userâ€™s own computer rather than a remote server",

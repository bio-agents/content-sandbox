                "abstract": "PubServer, available at http://pubserver.burnham.org/, is a agent to automatically collect, filter and analyze publications associated with groups of homologous proteins. Protein entries in databases such as Entrez Protein database at NCBI contain information about publications associated with a given protein. The scope of these publications varies a lot: they include studies focused on biochemical functions of individual proteins, but also reports from genome sequencing projects that introduce tens of thousands of proteins. Collecting and analyzing publications related to sets of homologous proteins help in functional annotation of novel protein families and in improving annotations of well-studied protein families or individual genes. However, performing such collection and analysis manually is a tedious and time-consuming process. PubServer automatically collects identifiers of homologous proteins using PSI-Blast, retrieves literature references from corresponding database entries and filters out publications unlikely to contain useful information about individual proteins. It also prepares simple vocabulary statistics from titles, abstracts and MeSH terms to identify the most frequently occurring keywords, which may help to quickly identify common themes in these publications. The filtering criteria applied to collected publications are user-adjustable. The results of the server are presented as an interactive page that allows re-filtering and different presentations of the output. Â© 2014 The Author(s).",

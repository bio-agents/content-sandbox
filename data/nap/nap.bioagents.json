    "description": "Nucleotide Amino Acid Alignment is a Java interface to the nap C program. The NAP program computes an optimal global alignment of a DNA sequence and a protein sequence without penalizing terminal gaps. NAP handles frameshifts and long introns in the DNA sequence. It delivers the alignment in linear space, so long sequences can be aligned. The experimental results demonstrate that NAP is a sensitive and powerful agent for finding genes by DNA-protein sequence homology.",

The alignment model of the methods addresses the problems of frameshifts and introns in the DNA sequence. The methods require computer memory proportional to the sequence lengths, so they can rigorously process very huge sequences. The simplified versions of the methods were implemented as computer programs named NAP and LAP. The experimental results demonstrate that the programs are sensitive and powerful agents for finding genes by DNA-protein sequence homology. Â© 1996, Oxford University Press.",

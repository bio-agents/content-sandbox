                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Structure-based pharmacophore models are often developed by selecting a single protein-ligand complex with good resolution and better binding affinity data which prevents the analysis of other structures having a similar potential to act as better templates. PharmRF is a pharmacophore-based scoring function for selecting the best crystal structures with the potential to attain high enrichment rates in pharmacophore-based virtual screening prospectively. The PharmRF scoring function is trained and tested on the PDBbind v2018 protein-ligand complex dataset and employs a random forest regressor to correlate protein pocket descriptors and ligand pharmacophoric elements with binding affinity. PharmRF score represents the calculated binding affinity which identifies high-affinity ligands by thorough pruning of all the PDB entries available for a particular protein of interest with a high PharmRF score. Ligands with high PharmRF scores can provide a better basis for structure-based pharmacophore enumerations with a better enrichment rate. Evaluated on 10 protein-ligand systems of the DUD-E dataset, PharmRF achieved superior performance (average success rate: 77.61%, median success rate: 87.16%) than Vina docking score (75.47%, 79.39%). PharmRF was further evaluated using the CASF-2016 benchmark set yielding a moderate correlation of 0.591 with experimental binding affinity, similar in performance to 25 scoring functions tested on this dataset. Independent assessment of PharmRF on 8 protein-ligand systems of LIT-PCBA dataset exhibited average and median success rates of 57.55% and 74.72% with 4 targets attaining success rate > 90%.

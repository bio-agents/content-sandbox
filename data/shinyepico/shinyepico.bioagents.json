    "description": "A graphical pipeline to analyze Illumina DNA methylation arrays.\n\nShinyÉPICo is a graphical pipeline to analyze Illumina DNA methylation arrays (450k or EPIC). It allows to calculate differentially methylated positions and differentially methylated regions in a user-friendly interface. Moreover, it includes several options to export the results and obtain files to perform downstream analysis.\n\nShinyÉPICo is a web interface based on Shiny that makes it easy to do differentially methylated CpGs analysis from Illumina EPIC or 450k DNA methylation arrays.\n\nShinyÉPICo can run in GNU Linux, Windows or macOS.\n\nDNAMethylation, DifferentialMethylation, Microarray, Preprocessing, QualityControl, Software.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: Illumina DNA methylation bead arrays provide a cost-effective platform for the simultaneous analysis of a high number of human samples. However, the analysis can be time-demanding and requires some computational expertise. shinyÉPICo is an interactive, web-based, and graphical agent that allows the user to analyze Illumina DNA methylation arrays (450k and EPIC), from the user's own computer or from a server. The agent covers the entire analysis, from the raw data to the final list of differentially methylated positions and differentially methylated regions between sample groups. It allows the user to test several normalization methods, linear model parameters, including covariates, and differentially methylated CpGs filters, in a quick and easy manner, with interactive graphics helping to select the options in each step. shinyÉPICo represents a comprehensive agent for standardizing and accelerating DNA methylation analysis, as well as optimizing computational resources in laboratories studying DNA methylation.",

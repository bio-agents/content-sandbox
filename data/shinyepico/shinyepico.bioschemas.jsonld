It allows to calculate differentially methylated positions and differentially methylated regions in a user-friendly interface. Moreover, it includes several options to export the results and obtain files to perform downstream analysis.\n\nShinyÉPICo is a web interface based on Shiny that makes it easy to do differentially methylated CpGs analysis from Illumina EPIC or 450k DNA methylation arrays.\n\nShinyÉPICo can run in GNU Linux, Windows or macOS.\n\nDNAMethylation, DifferentialMethylation, Microarray, Preprocessing, QualityControl, Software.",

    "description": "SMMPPI (Predicting Small-Molecule Modulators Of Protein-Protein Interactions) is a machine learning based agent to predict small molecule based modulators of Protein-Protein Interactions. It involves two-stages: At First, it predicts the compounds with potential to act as PPI modulators. In the next stage, PPI family specific predictors can be used to predict modulators for 11 clinically important PPI familes.",

For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Small molecule modulators of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are being pursued as novel anticancer, antiviral and antimicrobial drug candidates. We have utilized a large data set of experimentally validated PPI modulators and developed machine learning classifiers for prediction of new small molecule modulators of PPI. Our analysis reveals that using random forest (RF) classifier, general PPI Modulators independent of PPI family can be predicted with ROC-AUC higher than 0.9, when training and test sets are generated by random split. The performance of the classifier on data sets very different from those used in training has also been estimated by using different state of the art protocols for removing various types of bias in division of data into training and test sets. The family-specific PPIM predictors developed in this work for 11 clinically important PPI families also have prediction accuracies of above 90% in majority of the cases. All these ML-based predictors have been implemented in a freely available software named SMMPPI for prediction of small molecule modulators for clinically relevant PPIs like RBD:hACE2, Bromodomain_Histone, BCL2-Like_BAX/BAK, LEDGF_IN, LFA_ICAM, MDM2-Like_P53, RAS_SOS1, XIAP_Smac, WDR5_MLL1, KEAP1_NRF2 and CD4_gp120. We have identified novel chemical scaffolds as inhibitors for RBD_hACE PPI involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Docking studies for some of the compounds reveal that they can inhibit RBD_hACE2 interaction by high affinity binding to interaction hotspots on RBD. Some of these new scaffolds have also been found in SARS-CoV-2 viral growth inhibitors reported recently; however, it is not known if these molecules inhibit the entry phase.",

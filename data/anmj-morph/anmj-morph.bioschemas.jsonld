      "sc:description": "A simple ImageJ macro for rapid analysis of neuromuscular junction morphology.\n\nLarge-scale data analysis of synaptic morphology is becoming increasingly important to the field of neurobiological research (e.g. 'connectomics'). In particular, a detailed knowledge of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphology has proven to be important for understanding the form and function of synapses in both health and disease. The recent introduction of a standardized approach to the morphometric analysis of the NMJ-'NMJ-morph'-has provided the first common software platform with which to analyse and integrate NMJ data from different research laboratories. ImageJ macro language was used to encode the complete NMJ-morph workflow into seven navigation windows that generate robust data for 19 individual pre- post-synaptic variables",

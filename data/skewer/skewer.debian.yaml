  description: post-processing of high-throughput DNA sequence reads
  long_description: " skewer implements the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm\n\
    \ dedicated to the task of adapter trimming and it is specially designed\n for\
    \ processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) paired-end sequences.\n .\n Features\n\
    \ .\n  * Detection and removal of adapter sequences\n  * Insertion and deletion\
    \ allowed in pattern matching\n  * Targeted at Single End, Paired End (PE), and\
    \ Long Mate Pair (LMP) reads\n  * Demultiplexing of barcoded sequencing runs\n\
    \  * Multi-threading support\n  * Trimming based on phred quality scores\n  *\
    \ IUPAC characters for barcodes and adapters\n  * Compressed input and output\
    \ support\n"

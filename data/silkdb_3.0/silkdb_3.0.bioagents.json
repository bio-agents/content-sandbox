    "description": "SilkDB is an open-accessibility database and powerful platform that provides comprehensive information on the silkworm (Bombyx mori) genome. Since SilkDB 2.0 was released 10 years ago, vast quantities of data about multiple aspects of the silkworm have been generated, including genome, transcriptome, Hi-C and pangenome. To visualize data at these different biological levels, we present SilkDB 3.0 (https: silkdb.bioinfoagentkits.net), a visual analytic agent for exploring silkworm data through an interactive user interface.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.SilkDB is an open-accessibility database and powerful platform that provides comprehensive information on the silkworm (Bombyx mori) genome. Since SilkDB 2.0 was released 10 years ago, vast quantities of data about multiple aspects of the silkworm have been generated, including genome, transcriptome, Hi-C and pangenome. To visualize data at these different biological levels, we present SilkDB 3.0 (https://silkdb.bioinfoagentkits.net), a visual analytic agent for exploring silkworm data through an interactive user interface. The database contains a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the silkworm genome, and its coding sequences and gene sets are more accurate than those in the previous version. SilkDB 3.0 provides a view of the information for each gene at the levels of sequence, protein structure, gene family, orthology, synteny, genome organization and gives access to gene expression information, genetic variation and genome interaction map. A set of visualization agents are available to display the abundant information in the above datasets. With an improved interactive user interface for the integration of large data sets, the updated SilkDB 3.0 database will be a valuable resource for the silkworm and insect research community.",

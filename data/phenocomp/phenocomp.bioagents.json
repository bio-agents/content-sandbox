Thus, studies with only a particular type of disease samples (one phenotype) cannot be analyzed using common methods, such as significance analysis of microarrays, edgeR and limma. The RankComp algorithm, which was mainly developed to identify individual-level differentially expressed genes (DEGs), can be applied to identify population-level DEGs for the one-phenotype data but cannot identify the dysregulation directions of DEGs. Results: Here, we optimized the RankComp algorithm, termed PhenoComp. Compared with RankComp, PhenoComp provided the dysregulation directions of DEGs and had more robust detection power in both simulated and real one-phenotype data. Moreover, using the DEGs detected by common methods as the 'gold standard', the results showed that the DEGs detected by PhenoComp using only one-phenotype data were comparable to those identified by common methods using case-control samples, independent of the measurement platform. PhenoComp also exhibited good performance for weakly differential expression signal data. Availability and implementation: The PhenoComp algorithm is available on the web at https://github.com/XJJ-student/PhenoComp.",

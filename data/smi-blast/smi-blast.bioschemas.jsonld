      "sc:description": "a novel supervised search framework based on PSI-BLAST for protein remote homology detection.\n\nThe Basic Local Alignment Search Agent (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families.\n\nBLAST finds regions of similarity between biological sequences.\n\nResults: To uncover the reasons, we figured out three types of Incorrectly Selected Homology (ISH) errors in PSSMs.",

                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Worth and Espina.Monitoring the growth of bacterial cultures is one of the most common techniques in microbiology. This is usually achieved by using expensive and bulky spectrophotometric plate readers which periodically measure the optical density of bacterial cultures during the incubation period. In this study, we present a completely novel way of obtaining bacterial growth curves based on the classification of scanned images of cultures rather than using spectrophotometric measurements. We trained a deep learning model with images of bacterial broths contained in microplates, and we integrated it into a custom-made software application that triggers a flatbed scanner to timely capture images, automatically processes the images, and represents all growth curves. The developed agent, ScanGrow, is presented as a low-cost and high-throughput alternative to plate readers, and it only requires a computer connected to a flatbed scanner and equipped with our open-source ScanGrow application. In addition, this application also assists in the pre-processing of data to create and evaluate new models, having the potential to facilitate many routine microbiological techniques.",

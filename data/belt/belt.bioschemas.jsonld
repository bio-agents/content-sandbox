This is the engine used in our published web application W-ChIPeaks, meant to be used as a command-line application. Although it does not include all of the features of W-ChIPeaks (such as archive support and target FDR) as some of these are implemented by the Web-based framework, it is nonetheless a full-fledged standalone peakcalling utility.",

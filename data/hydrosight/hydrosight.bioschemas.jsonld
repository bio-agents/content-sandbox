Just edit, push, and your changes are live.\n\nWebsites for you and your projects.\n\nHydroSight is a highly flexible statistical agentbox for quantitative hydrogeological insights. It comprises of a powerful groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling and simulation framework plus a data quality analysis module. Multiple models can be built for one bore, allowing statistical identification of the dominant processes, or 100â€™s of bores can be modelled to quantify aquifer heterogeneity. This flexibility allows many novel applications such as:.",

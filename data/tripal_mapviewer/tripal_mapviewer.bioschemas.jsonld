      "sc:description": "A agent for interactive visualization and comparison of genetic maps.\n\nTripal is an open-source, resource-efficient agentkit for construction of genomic, genetic and breeding databases. It facilitates development of biological websites by providing agents to integrate and display biological data using the generic database schema, Chado, together with Drupal, a popular website creation and content management system. Tripal MapViewer is a new interactive agent for visualizing genetic map data. Developed as a Tripal replacement for Comparative Map Viewer (CMap), it enables visualization of entire maps or linkage groups and features such as molecular markers, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and heritable phenotypic markers. It also provides graphical comparison of maps sharing the same markers as well as dot plot and correspondence matrices",

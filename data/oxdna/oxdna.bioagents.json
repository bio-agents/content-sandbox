    "description": "oxDNA.org is a public webserver for coarse-grained simulations of DNA and RNA nanostructures. The goal is to facilitate development of more advanced and complex designs in the fields of DNA and RNA nanotechnology by facilitating non-experts to run simple simulations. This server uses oxDNA and oxRNA models to simulate DNA and RNA nanostructures to verify and prototype novel designs. The simulations this server supports are equilibrium sampling of assembled designs, meant to assist users to test in silico their designs before taking them to the lab. The server is provided for free for anyone.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.OxDNA and oxRNA are popular coarse-grained models used by the DNA/RNA nanotechnology community to prototype, analyze and rationalize designed DNA and RNA nanostructures. Here, we present oxDNA.org, a graphical web interface for running, visualizing and analyzing oxDNA and oxRNA molecular dynamics simulations on a GPU-enabled high performance computing server. OxDNA.org automatically generates simulation files, including a multi-step relaxation protocol for structures exported in non-physical states from DNA/RNA design agents. Once the simulation is complete, oxDNA.org provides an interactive visualization and analysis interface using the browser-based visualizer oxView to facilitate the understanding of simulation results for a user's specific structure. This online agent significantly lowers the entry barrier of integrating simulations in the nanostructure design pipeline for users who are not experts in the technical aspects of molecular simulation. The webserver is freely available at oxdna.org.",

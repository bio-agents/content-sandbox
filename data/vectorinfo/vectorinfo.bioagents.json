    "description": "A web resource for medically important Indian arthropod disease vectors.\n\nVectorInfo is a freely accessible web resource, emphasised on medically important Indian arthropods funded by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and maintained by one of its premier institute, Vector Control Research Centre (VCRC). VectorInfo elucidates and curates medically important Indian arthropod's biological, omics technologies to adopt a holistic view of the molecules that make up an organism, aimed at the detection of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, enzymes & pathways and immune specific genes. The nitty-gritty of VectorInfo is aimed at scrutinizing all the possible information on Indian disease vectors in a single window for the scientific community. The database affords 53 medically important Indian arthropod's biological and omics information well-structured and provided with downloadable facilities",

The database affords 53 medically important Indian arthropod's biological and omics information well-structured and provided with downloadable facilities. In addition to this, huge number of research articles were mined in the quest for gathering the recommended insecticide targets and their mechanisms, that pave ways to design and develop novel lead molecules through computational means. This current up-to-date database contains 2,498 omics entries beneficial for the molecular studies and analysis. In order to maintain regular updates, user forms were provided for the scientific community to submit research data to the database administrator. The VectorInfo furthermore conveys various resources for vector control and diagnostics and the links to the crucial software agents used for the Bioinformatics analysis.",

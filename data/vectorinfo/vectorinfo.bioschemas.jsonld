      "sc:description": "A web resource for medically important Indian arthropod disease vectors.\n\nVectorInfo is a freely accessible web resource, emphasised on medically important Indian arthropods funded by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and maintained by one of its premier institute, Vector Control Research Centre (VCRC). VectorInfo elucidates and curates medically important Indian arthropod's biological, omics technologies to adopt a holistic view of the molecules that make up an organism, aimed at the detection of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, enzymes & pathways and immune specific genes. The nitty-gritty of VectorInfo is aimed at scrutinizing all the possible information on Indian disease vectors in a single window for the scientific community. The database affords 53 medically important Indian arthropod's biological and omics information well-structured and provided with downloadable facilities",

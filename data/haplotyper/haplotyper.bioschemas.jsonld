After which, other macros will extract the haplotype information, calculate linkage disequilibrium between markers, and prepare an input sheet for the “GOLD” program. Then, a last macro can reconstruct the haplotypes of each individual in the population,using a maximum likelihood method and the haplotypes present in the population as proposed by Arlequin.",

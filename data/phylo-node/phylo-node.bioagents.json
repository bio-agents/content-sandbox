JavaScript has been used to develop very fast and user-friendly front-end agents for bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses. However, no such agentkits are available using Node.js to conduct comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis. Results To address this problem, I have developed, phylo-node, which was developed using Node. js and provides a stable and scalable agentkit that allows the user to perform diverse molecular and phylogenetic tasks. phylo-node can execute the analysis and process the resulting outputs from a suite of software options that provides agents for read processing and genome alignment, sequence retrieval, multiple sequence alignment, primer design, evolutionary modeling, and phylogeny reconstruction. Furthermore, phylo-node enables the user to deploy server dependent applications, and also provides simple integration and interoperation with other Node modules and languages using Node inheritance patterns, and a customized piping module to support the production of diverse pipelines. Conclusions phylo-node is open-source and freely available to all users without sign-up or login requirements.

description: Elprep is a high-performance agent for preparing .sam/.bam files for variant
  calling in sequencing pipelines. it can be used as a drop-in replacement for samagents/picard/gatk4,
  and was extensively tested with different pipelines for variant analysis with gatk.
  the key advantage of elprep is that it only performs a single-pass to process a
  .sam/.bam file, independent of the number of processing steps that need to be applied
  in a particular pipeline, greatly improving runtime performance.

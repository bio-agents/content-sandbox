description: Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by different processes,
  comprising inhibition or activation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional
  degradation by microRNAs. biRte uses regulatory networks of TFs, miRNAs and possibly
  other factors, together with mRNA, miRNA and other available expression data to
  predict the relative influence of a regulator on the expression of its target genes.
  Inference is done in a Bayesian modeling framework using Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo.
  A special feature is the possibility for follow-up network reverse engineering between
  active regulators.

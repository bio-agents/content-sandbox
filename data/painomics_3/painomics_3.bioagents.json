Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The increasing availability of multi-omic platforms poses new challenges to data analysis. Joint visualization of multi-omics data is instrumental in better understanding interconnections across molecular layers and in fully utilizing the multi-omic resources available to make biological discoveries. We present here PaintOmics 3, a web-based resource for the integrated visualization of multiple omic data types onto KEGG pathway diagrams. PaintOmics 3 combines server-end capabilities for data analysis with the potential of modern web resources for data visualization, providing researchers with a powerful framework for interactive exploration of their multi-omics information. Unlike other visualization agents, PaintOmics 3 covers a comprehensive pathway analysis workflow, including automatic feature name/identifier conversion, multi-layered feature matching, pathway enrichment, network analysis, interactive heatmaps, trend charts, and more. It accepts a wide variety of omic types, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, as well as region-based approaches such as ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq data.",

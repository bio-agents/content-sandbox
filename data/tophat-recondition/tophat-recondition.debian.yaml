  description: post-processor for TopHat unmapped reads
  long_description: " tophat-recondition is a post-processor for TopHat unmapped reads\n\
    \ (contained in unmapped.bam), making them compatible with downstream\n agents\
    \ (e.g., the Picard suite, samagents, GATK) (TopHat issue #17). It\n also works\
    \ around bugs in TopHat:\n .\n  * the \"mate is unmapped\" SAM flag is not set\
    \ on any reads in the\n    unmapped.bam file (TopHat issue #3)\n  * the mapped\
    \ mate of an unmapped read can be absent from\n    accepted_hits.bam, creating\
    \ a mismatch between the file and the unmapped\n    read's flags (TopHat issue\
    \ #16)\n"

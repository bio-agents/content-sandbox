Published by BMJ.Background Checkpoint targets play a key role in tumor-mediated immune escape and therefore are critical for cancer immunotherapy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of bioinformatics resource that compile all the checkpoint targets for translational research and drug discovery in immuno-oncology. Methods To this end, we developed checkpoint therapeutic target database (CKTTD), the first comprehensive database for immune checkpoint targets (proteins, miRNAs and LncRNAs) and their modulators. A scoring system was adopted to filter more relevant targets with high confidence. In addition, a few biological databases such as Oncomine, Drugbank, miRBase and Lnc2Cancer database were integrated into CKTTD to provide an in-depth information. Moreover, we computed and provided ligand-binding site information for all the targets which may support bench scientists for drug discovery efforts. Results In total, CKTTD compiles 105 checkpoint protein targets, 53 modulators (small-molecules and antibody), 30 miRNAs and 18 LncRNAs in cancer immunotherapy with validated experimental evidences curated from 10 649 literatures via an enhanced text-mining system. Conclusions In conclusion, the CKTTD may serve as a useful platform for the research of cancer immunotherapy and drug discovery.",

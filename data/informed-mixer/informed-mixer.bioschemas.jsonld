This is work in progress, but eventually it should singificantly improve user experience, as Python allows much simpler installation procedures, makes it less error prone, allows to implement well-documented command-line interface (python mixer.py --help), and provide visualization.\n\nInput data for MiXeR consists of summary statistics from a GWAS, and a reference panel.",

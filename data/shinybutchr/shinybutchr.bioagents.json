    "description": "Interactive NMF-based decomposition workflow of genome-scale datasets.\n\nShinyButchR is an interactive R/Shiny app to perform NMF on an input matrix. ShinyButchR uses ButchR (https://github.com/wurst-theke/ButchR) to run the matrix decomposition and generate diagnostic plots and visualizations that helps to find association of the NMF signatures to known biological factors.\n\nButchR is an R package providing functions to perform non-negative matrix factorization and postprocessing using TensorFlow.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used for the analysis of genomic data to perform feature extraction and signature identification due to the interpretability of the decomposed signatures. However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple agents and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables. ShinyButchR builds upon the also novel R package ButchR, which provides new TensorFlow solvers for algorithms of the NMF family, functions for downstream analysis, a rational method to determine the optimal factorization rank and a novel feature selection strategy.",

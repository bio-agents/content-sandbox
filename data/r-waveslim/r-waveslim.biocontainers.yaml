description: Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D) and array (3D)
  analysis. The code provided here is based on wavelet methodology developed in Percival
  and Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex wavelet
  transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert
  wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002). All figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001)
  are reproducible using this package and R code available at the book website(s)
  below.

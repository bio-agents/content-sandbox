                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Prime editing technology is capable of generating targeted insertions, deletions, and base conversions. However, the process of designing prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs), which contain a primer binding site and a reverse-transcription template at the 3′ end, is more complex than that for the single guide RNAs used with CRISPR nucleases or base editors. Furthermore, the assessment of high-throughput sequencing data after prime editors (PEs) have been employed should consider the unique feature of PEs; thus, pre-existing assessment agents cannot directly be adopted for PEs. Here, we present two user-friendly web-based agents for PEs, named PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer. PE-Designer, a dedicated agent for pegRNA selection, provides all possible target sequences, pegRNA extension sequences, and nicking guide RNA sequences together with useful information, and displays the results in an interactive image. PE-Analyzer, a dedicated agent for PE outcome analysis, accepts high-throughput sequencing data, summarizes mutation-related information in a table, and provides interactive graphs. PE-Analyzer was mainly written using JavaScript so that it can analyze several data sets without requiring that huge sequencing data (>100MB) be uploaded to the server, reducing analysis time and increasing personal security. PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer are freely available at http://www.rgenome.net/pe-designer/ and http://www.rgenome.net/pe-analyzer/ without a login process.",

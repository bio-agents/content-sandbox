      "sc:description": "Differential gene usage in immune repertoires.\n\nDecoding the properties of immune repertoires is key in understanding the response of adaptive immunity to challenges such as viral infection. One important task in immune repertoire profiling is the detection of biases in Ig gene usage between biological conditions. IgGeneUsage is a computational agent for the analysis of differential gene usage in immune repertoires. It employs Bayesian hierarchical models to fit complex gene usage data from immune repertoire sequencing experiments and quantifies Ig gene usage biases as probabilities.",

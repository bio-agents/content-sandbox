description: This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing
  and analyzing. It introduces a unique metagenomic systems biology approach, mapping
  metagenomic data to the KEGG global metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level
  network. The system-level network and the next topological analysis will be of great
  help to analysis the various functional properties, including regulation and metabolic
  functionality of the metagenome.

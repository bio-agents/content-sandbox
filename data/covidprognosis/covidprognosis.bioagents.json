However, the identification of biomarkers associated with survival and deaths remains a major challenge for early prognosis. In the present study, we have evaluated and developed AI-based prediction algorithms for predicting a COVID-19 patient’s survival or death based on a publicly available dataset consisting of clinical parameters and protein profile data of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients. The best classification model based on clinical parameters achieved a maximum accuracy of 89.47% for predicting survival or death of COVID-19 patients, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.71 and 92.45%, respectively. The classification model based on normalized protein expression values of 45 proteins achieved a maximum accuracy of 89.01% for predicting the survival or death, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.68 and 86%, respectively. Interestingly, we identified 9 clinical and 45 protein-based putative biomarkers associated with the survival/death of COVID-19 patients. Based on our findings, few clinical features and proteins correlate significantly with the literature and reaffirm their role in the COVID-19 disease progression at the molecular level. The machine learning–based models developed in the present study have the potential to predict the survival chances of COVID-19 positive patients in the early stages of the disease or at the time of hospitalization. However, this has to be verified on a larger cohort of patients before it can be put to actual clinical practice. We have also developed a webserver CovidPrognosis, where clinical information can be uploaded to predict the survival chances of a COVID-19 patient. The webserver is available at http://14.139.62.220/covidprognosis/.",

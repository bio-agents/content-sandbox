This agent is customized to help the user find appropriate SNOMED CT concepts quickly, and has implications for the successful implementation of data standards to facilitate high quality research data. This paper gives an overview of an automated agent for accessing, searching, and navigating SNOMED CT real-time, at distributed and remote clinical study locations. Also, the features of the agent that enable complete data are presented, as well as possible metrics for evaluation in terms of compliance, consistency, and reliability of coding.

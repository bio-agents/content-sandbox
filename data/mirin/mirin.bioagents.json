Mirin is a web-based application suitable for identifying functional modules from protein- protein interaction networks regulated by aberrant miRNAs under user-defined biological conditions such as cancers. The analysis involves combining miRNA regulations, protein-protein interactions between target genes, as well as mRNA and miRNA expression profiles provided by users. Mirin has successfully uncovered oncomirs and their regulatory networks in various cancers, such as gastric and breast cancer. Â© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

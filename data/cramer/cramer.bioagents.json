    "description": "The Cranfield Genome Browser (CRAMER) is a lightweight, highly customizable web-based genome browser supporting multiple visualization instances. CRAMER is a customisable, JavaScript and Jade based genome browser for interactive exploration of genomic data. Data is visualized in the browser, meaning CRAMER can be installed on any website and show data from a wide range of online, ftp links or local sources. CRAMER works with a variety of formats, such as XML, JSON, BED, VCF, GFF, GFF3, BAM or delimited text files, and can be customised to parse and display any data source as required.",

All rights reserved.In recent years, the ability to generate genomic data has increased dramatically along with the demand for easily personalized and customizable genome browsers for effective visualization of diverse types of data. Despite the large number of web-based genome browsers available nowadays, none of the existing agents provides means for creating multiple visualization instances without manual set up on the deployment server side. The Cranfield Genome Browser (CRAMER) is an open-source, lightweight and highly customizable web application for interactive visualization of genomic data. Once deployed, CRAMER supports seamless creation of multiple visualization instances in parallel while allowing users to control and customize multiple tracks. The application is deployed on a Node.js server and is supported by a MongoDB database which stored all customizations made by the users allowing quick navigation between instances. Currently, the browser supports visualizing a large number of file formats for genome annotation, variant calling, reads coverage and gene expression. Additionally, the browser supports direct Javascript coding for personalized tracks, providing a whole new level of customization both functionally and visually. Tracks can be added via direct file upload or processed in real-time via links to files stored remotely on an FTP repository. Furthermore, additional tracks can be added by users via simple drag and drop to an existing visualization instance.",

    "description": "a snakemake pipeline for scalable HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing | SNAPPy is a Snakemake pipeline for HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing | This is the repository for SNAPPy, a Snakemake pipeline for HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. SNAPPy allows high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping locally while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using Snakemake , and it uses MAFFT and for multiple sequence alignment, BLAST for similarirty querys, IQ-TREE for phylogenetic inference, and several Biopython modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the agent works please visit the documentation page.

                "abstract": "© 2019 The Author(s).Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) genome sequencing is routinely done for drug resistance monitoring in hospitals worldwide. Subtyping these extensive datasets of HIV-1 sequences is a critical first step in molecular epidemiology and evolution studies. The clinical relevance of HIV-1 subtypes is increasingly recognized. Several studies suggest subtype-related differences in disease progression, transmission route efficiency, immune evasion, and even therapeutic outcomes. HIV-1 subtyping is mainly done using web-servers. These agents have limitations in scalability and potential noncompliance with data protection legislation. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop an efficient method for large-scale local HIV-1 subtyping. We designed SNAPPy: a snakemake pipeline for scalable HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. It contains several tasks of phylogenetic inference and BLAST queries, which can be executed sequentially or in parallel, taking advantage of multiple-core processing units. Although it was built for subtyping, SNAPPy is also useful to perform extensive HIV-1 alignments. This agent facilitates large-scale sequence-based HIV-1 research by providing a local, resource efficient and scalable alternative for HIV-1 subtyping. It is capable of analyzing full-length genomes or partial HIV-1 genomic regions (GAG, POL, and ENV) and recognizes more than ninety circulating recombinant forms.

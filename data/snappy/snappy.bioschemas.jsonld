SNAPPy allows high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping locally while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using Snakemake , and it uses MAFFT and for multiple sequence alignment, BLAST for similarirty querys, IQ-TREE for phylogenetic inference, and several Biopython modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the agent works please visit the documentation page. SNAPPy was design for Linux based operative systems | Welcome to snappy’s documentation! — SNAPPy-HIV1-Subtyping 1.0.0 documentation | Free document hosting provided by Read the Docs",

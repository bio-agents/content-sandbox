Then, computes the Kendall Tau-b correlation coefficient between the user's ordering and the optimal ordering.\n\nNote that SEPIA can use any dataset produced by FAVITES: we just happened to reuse this dataset in the SEPIA manuscript. SEPIA itself is completely generalizable to any simulation conditions.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.agents/sepia-phase\n\n||| NAME (SEPIA) SIMILAR TO (PUB.

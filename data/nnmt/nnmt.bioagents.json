                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Layer, Senk, Essink, van Meegen, Bos and Helias.Mean-field theory of neuronal networks has led to numerous advances in our analytical and intuitive understanding of their dynamics during the past decades. In order to make mean-field based analysis agents more accessible, we implemented an extensible, easy-to-use open-source Python agentbox that collects a variety of mean-field methods for the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. The Neuronal Network Mean-field Agentbox (NNMT) in its current state allows for estimating properties of large neuronal networks, such as firing rates, power spectra, and dynamical stability in mean-field and linear response approximation, without running simulations. In this article, we describe how the agentbox is implemented, show how it is used to reproduce results of previous studies, and discuss different use-cases, such as parameter space explorations, or mapping different network models. Although the initial version of the agentbox focuses on methods for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, its structure is designed to be open and extensible. It aims to provide a platform for collecting analytical methods for neuronal network model analysis, such that the neuroscientific community can take maximal advantage of them.",

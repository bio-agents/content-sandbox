description: Predictprotein is a protein sequence analysis and structure prediction
  agent.  users provide a protein sequence, and predictprotein reports similar sequences,
  prosite sequence motifs, and various types of structure prediction information.  you
  can also use meta predictprotein to submit a sequence to one web form and query
  several other servers at once, retrieving the results by e-mail.

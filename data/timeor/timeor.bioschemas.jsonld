Click here for a quick video demonstration of the TIMEOR application, and click here for a video guide through the tutorial below.\n\nAnalyzing time series differential gene expression and other multi-omics data is computationally laborious and full of complex choices for the various types of time series experiment analyses. The TIMEOR web-application offers a solution as an interactive and adaptive R-Shiny web interface to support reproducibility and the best agents for a given experimental design.",

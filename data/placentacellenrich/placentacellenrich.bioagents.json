    "description": "A agent to characterize gene sets using placenta cell-specific gene enrichment analysis.\n\nSingle-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has improved our understanding of individual cell types in the human placenta. However, placental scRNA-Seq data is not readily accessible when trying to understand how expression patterns in model systems correspond to those from first trimester human placenta. Therefore, we developed PlacentaCellEnrich, a agent that takes a gene set as input, and then reports if the input set is enriched for genes with placenta cell-specific expression patterns, based on human placenta scRNA-Seq data.

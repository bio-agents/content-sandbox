                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Complex enzymatic models are required for analyzing kinetic data derived under conditions that may not satisfy the assumptions associated with Michaelis–Menten kinetics. To analyze these data, several software packages have been developed. However, the complexity introduced by these programs is often dispensable when analyzing data conforming to the canonical Michaelis–Menten model. In these cases, the sophisticated routines of these packages become inefficient and unnecessarily intricated for the intended purpose, reason for which most users resort to general-purpose graphing programs. However, this approach, in addition of being time-consuming, is prone to human error, and can lead to misleading estimates of kinetic parameters, particularly when unweighted regression analyses of transformed kinetic data are performed. Results: To fill the existing gap between highly specialized and general-purpose software, we have developed an easy-to-use R package, renz, designed for accurate and efficient estimation of enzyme kinetic parameters. The package provides different methods that can be clustered into four categories, depending on whether they are based on data fitting to a single progress curve (evolution of substrate concentration over time) or, alternatively, based on the dependency of initial rates on substrate concentration (differential rate equation). A second criterion to be considered is whether the experimental data need to be manipulated to obtain linear functions or, alternatively, data are directly fitted using non-linear regression analysis. The current program is a cross-platform, free and open-source software that can be obtained from the CRAN repository. The package is accompanied by five vignettes, which are intended to guide users to choose the appropriate method in each case, as well as providing the basic theoretical foundations of each method. These vignettes use real experimental data to illustrate the use of the package utilities. Conclusions: renz is a rigorous and yet easy-to-use software devoted to the analysis of kinetic data. This application has been designed to meet the needs of users who are not practicing enzymologists, but who need to accurately estimate the kinetic parameters of enzymes. The current software saves time and minimizes the risk of making mistakes or introducing biases due to uncorrected error propagation effects.",

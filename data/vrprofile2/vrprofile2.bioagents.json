Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.VRprofile2 is an updated pipeline that rapidly identifies diverse mobile genetic elements in bacterial genome sequences. Compared with the previous version, three major improvements were made. First, the user-friendly visualization could aid users in investigating the antibiotic resistance gene cassettes in conjunction with various mobile elements in the multiple resistance region with mosaic structure. VRprofile2 could compare the predicted mobile elements to the collected known mobile elements with similar architecture. A new mobilome indicator was proposed to give an overall estimation of the mobilome size in individual bacterial genomes. Second, the relationship between antibiotic resistance genes, mobile elements, and host strains would be efficiently examined with the aid of predicted strain's sequence typing, the incompatibility group and the transferability of plasmids. Finally, the updated back-end database, MobilomeDB2, now collected nearly a thousand active mobile elements retrieved from literature or based on prediction. The pre-computed results of the antibiotic resistance gene-carrying mobile elements of >5500 ESKAPEE genomes were also provided. We expect that VRprofile2 will provide better support for researchers interested in bacterial mobile elements and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

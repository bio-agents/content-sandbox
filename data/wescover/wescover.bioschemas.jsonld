      "sc:description": "WEScover is a novel web application that provides an interface for discovering breadth and depth of coverage across population scale WES datasets, searching either by phenotype, by targeted gene panels and by genes. Moreover, the application shows metrics from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to provide gene-centric view on breadth of coverage. Through the efficent querying of genes and phenotypes for exome coverage of associated exons, WEScover provides recommendations for gene panel tests of genes that are not well covered by whole exome sequencing.",

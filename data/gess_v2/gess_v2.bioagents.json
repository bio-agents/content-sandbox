Including the agents in the first version, the GESS v2 is embedded with new functions, which allow users to search SNVs, given the viral nucleotide or amino acid sequence. The GESS v2 helps users to identify SNVs or SARS-CoV-2 lineages enriched in countries of user’s interest and show the migration path of a selected lineage on a world map during specific time periods chosen by the users. In addition, the GESS v2 can recognize the dynamic variations of newly emerging SNVs in each month to help users monitor SNVs, which will potentially become dominant soon. More importantly, multiple sets of analyzed results about SNVs can be downloaded directly from the GESS v2 by which users can conduct their own independent research. With these significant updates, the GESS v2 will continue to serve as a public open platform for researchers to explore SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary patterns from the perspectives of the prevalence and impact of SNVs.",

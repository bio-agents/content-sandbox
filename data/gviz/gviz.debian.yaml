description: Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic
  information and new experimental data. Gviz uses the biomaRt and the rtracklayer
  packages to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and UCSC and translates this
  to e.g. gene/transcript structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This
  results in genomic information plotted together with your data.

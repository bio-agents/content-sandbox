                "abstract": "The PRINTS database houses a collection of protein family fingerprints. These are groups of motifs that together are diagnostically more potent than single motifs by virtue of the biological context afforded by matching motif neighbours. Around 1200 fingerprints have now been created and stored in the database. The September 1999 release (version 24.0) encodes ~ 7200 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on. In addition to its continued steady growth, we report here several major changes to the resource, including the design of an automated strategy for database maintenance, and implementation of an object-relational schema for more efficient data management. The database is accessible for BLAST, fingerprint and text searches at http://www.bioinf. man.ac.uk/dbbrowser/PRINTS/.",

EBI Search (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch) provides a full-text search engine across nearly 5 billion entries, while the Job Dispatcher agents framework (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services) enables the scientific community to perform a diverse range of sequence analysis using popular bioinformatics applications. Both allow users to interact through user-friendly web applications, as well as via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs. Here, we describe recent improvements to these services and updates made to accommodate the increasing data requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

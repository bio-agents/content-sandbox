      "sc:description": "An Innovative Agentbox for Synthesizing Regular and Irregular Photoplethysmography Waveforms.\n\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) is increasingly used in digital health, exceptionally in smartwatches. The PPG signal contains valuable information about heart activity, and there is lots of research interest in its means and analysis for cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no arrhythmic PPG dataset publicly available-this paper attempt to provide a agentbox that can generate synthesized arrhythmic PPG signals. The model of a single PPG pulse in this agentbox utilizes two combined Gaussian functions. This agentbox supports synthesizing PPG waveform with regular heartbeats and three irregular heartbeats: compensation, interpolation, and reset",

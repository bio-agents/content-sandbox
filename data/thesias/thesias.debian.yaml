  description: Testing Haplotype Effects In Association Studies
  long_description: " The objectif of the THESIAS program is to performed haplotype-based\n\
    \ association analysis in unrelated individuals. This program is based\n on the\
    \ maximum likelihood model described in Tregouet et al. 2002\n (Hum Mol Genet\
    \ 2002,11: 2015-2023) and is linked to the SEM algorithm\n (Tregouet et al. Ann\
    \ Hum Genet 2004,68: 165-177).\n THESIAS allows one to simultaneous estimate haplotype\
    \ frequencies\n and their associate effects on the phenotype of interest.\n In\
    \ this new THESIAS release, quantitative, qualitative (logistic\n and matched-pair\
    \ analysis), categorical and survival outcomes can be\n studied. X-linked haplotype\
    \ analysis is also feasible.\n Covariate-adjusted haplotype effects as well as\
    \ haplotype x covariate\n interactions can also be investigated.\n"

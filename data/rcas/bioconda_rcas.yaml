bioagents_id: rcas
description: RCAS is an R/Bioconductor package designed as a generic reporting agent
  for the functional analysis of transcriptome-wide regions of interest detected by
  high-throughput experiments. Such transcriptomic regions could be, for instance,
  signal peaks detected by CLIP-Seq analysis for protein-RNA interaction sites, RNA
  modification sites (alias the epitranscriptome), CAGE-tag locations, or any other
  collection of query regions at the level of the transcriptome. RCAS produces in-depth
  annotation summaries and coverage profiles based on the distribution of the query
  regions with respect to transcript features (exons, introns, 5'/3' UTR regions,
  exon-intron boundaries, promoter regions). Moreover, RCAS can carry out functional
  enrichment analyses and discriminative motif discovery.

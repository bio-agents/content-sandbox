                "abstract": "© 2019 The Protein SocietyMolecular docking of peptides to proteins can be a useful agent in the exploration of the possible peptide binding sites and poses. CABS-dock is a method for protein–peptide docking that features significant conformational flexibility of both the peptide and the protein molecules during the peptide search for a binding site. The CABS-dock has been made available as a web server and a standalone package. The web server is an easy to use agent with a simple web interface. The standalone package is a command-line program dedicated to professional users. It offers a number of advanced features, analysis agents and support for large-sized systems. In this article, we outline the current status of the CABS-dock method, its recent developments, applications, and challenges ahead.",

We aimed to identify P. knowlesi novel binding peptides through a random linear dodecapeptide phage display targeting the 19-kDa fragment of Merozoite Surface Protein-1 protein. Methods: rPkMSP-119 protein was heterologously expressed using Expresso® Solubility and Expression Screening System and competent E. cloni® 10G cells according to protocol. Three rounds of biopanning were performed on purified rPkMSP-119 to identify binding peptides towards rPkMSP-119 using Ph.D.™-12 random phage display library. Binding sites of the identified peptides to PkMSP-119 were in silico predicted using the CABS-dock web server. Results: Four phage peptide variants that bound to PkMSP-119 were identified after three rounds of biopanning, namely Pkd1, Pkd2, Pkd3 and Pkd4. The sequences of both Pkd1 and Pkd2 consist of a large number of histidine residues. Pkd1 showed positive binding signal with 6.1× vs. BSA control. Docking results showed that Pkd1 and Pkd2 were ideal binding peptides for PkMSP-119. Conclusion: We identified two novel binding peptides of PkMSP-119, Pkd1 (HFPFHHHKLRAH) and Pkd2 (HPMHMLHKRQHG), through phage display. They provide a valuable starting point for the development of novel therapeutics.",

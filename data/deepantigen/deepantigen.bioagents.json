All rights reserved.Motivation: The mutations of cancers can encode the seeds of their own destruction, in the form of T-cell recognizable immunogenic peptides, also known as neoantigens. It is computationally challenging, however, to accurately prioritize the potential neoantigen candidates according to their ability of activating the T-cell immunoresponse, especially when the somatic mutations are abundant. Although a few neoantigen prioritization methods have been proposed to address this issue, advanced machine learning model that is specifically designed to tackle this problem is still lacking. Moreover, none of the existing methods considers the original DNA loci of the neoantigens in the perspective of 3D genome which may provide key information for inferring neoantigens' immunogenicity. Results: In this study, we discovered that DNA loci of the immunopositive and immunonegative MHC-I neoantigens have distinct spatial distribution patterns across the genome. We therefore used the 3D genome information along with an ensemble pMHC-I coding strategy, and developed a group feature selection-based deep sparse neural network model (DNN-GFS) that is optimized for neoantigen prioritization. DNN-GFS demonstrated increased neoantigen prioritization power comparing to existing sequence-based approaches. We also developed a webserver named deepAntigen (http://yishi.sjtu.edu.cn/deepAntigen) that implements the DNN-GFS as well as other machine learning methods. We believe that this work provides a new perspective toward more accurate neoantigen prediction which eventually contribute to personalized cancer immunotherapy. Availability and implementation: Data and implementation are available on webserver: http://yishi.sjtu.edu.cn/ deepAntigen.",

                "abstract": "Background: Genomic position (GP) files currently used in next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are always difficult to manipulate due to their huge size and the lack of appropriate agents to properly manage them. The structure of these flat files is based on representing one line per position that has been covered by at least one aligned read, imposing significant restrictions from a computational performance perspective.Results: PileLine implements a flexible command-line agentkit providing specific support to the management, filtering, comparison and annotation of GP files produced by NGS experiments. PileLine agents are coded in Java and run on both UNIX (Linux, Mac OS) and Windows platforms. The set of agents comprising PileLine are designed to be memory efficient by performing fast seek on-disk operations over sorted GP files.Conclusions: Our novel agentbox has been extensively tested taking into consideration performance issues.

                "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are making sequence data available on an unprecedented scale. In this context, new catalogs of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and mutations generated by resequencing studies are usually stored in genome position files (e.g. Variant Call Format, SAMAgents pileup, BED, GFF) comprising of large lists of genomic positions, which are difficult to handle by researchers. Here, we present PileLineGUI, a novel desktop application primarily designed for manipulating, browsing and analysing genome position files (GPF), with specific support to somatic mutation finding studies. The developed agent also integrates a new genome browser module specially designed for inspecting GPFs. PileLineGUI is free, multiplatform and designed to be intuitively used by biomedical researchers.

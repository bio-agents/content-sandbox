This paper describes support vector machine (SVM) based method developed for identifying HLA-DRB1*0401 binding peptides in an antigenic sequence. SVM was trained and tested on large and clean data set consisting of 567 binders and equal number of non-binders. The accuracy of the method was 86% when evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation technique. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; All rights reserved.",

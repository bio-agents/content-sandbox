      "sc:description": "ThresholdNet with Confidence-Guided Manifold Mixup for Polyp Segmentation.\n\nThe automatic segmentation of polyp in endoscopy images is crucial for early diagnosis and cure of colorectal cancer. Existing deep learning-based methods for polyp segmentation, however, are inadequate due to the limited annotated dataset and the class imbalance problems. Moreover, these methods obtained the final polyp segmentation results by simply thresholding the likelihood maps at an eclectic and equivalent value (often set to 0.5). In this paper, we propose a novel ThresholdNet with a confidence-guided manifold mixup (CGMMix) data augmentation method, mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in polyp segmentation. The CGMMix conducts manifold mixup at the image and feature levels, and adaptively lures the decision boundary away from the under-represented polyp class with the confidence guidance to alleviate the limited training dataset and the class imbalance problems",

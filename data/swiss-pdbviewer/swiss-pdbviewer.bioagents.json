                "abstract": "Comparative protein modeling is increasingly gaining interest since it is of great assistance during the rational design of mutagenesis experiments. The availability of this method, and the resulting models, has however been restricted by the availability of expensive computer hardware and software. To overcome these limitations, we have developed an environment for comparative protein modeling that consists of SWISS-MODEL, a server for automated comparative protein modeling and of the SWISS-PdbViewer, a sequence to structure workbench. The Swiss-PdbViewer not only acts as a client for SWISS-MODEL, but also provides a-large selection of structure analysis and display agents. In addition, we provide the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a database containing more than 3500 automatically generated protein models. By making such agents freely available to the scientific community, we hope to increase the use of protein structures and models in the process of experiment design.",

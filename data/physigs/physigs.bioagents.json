    "description": "PhySigs uses the input of a phylogeny with nodes representing clones in a patient tumor, a signature matrix containing the set of mutational signatures to use in the analysis, and a feature matrix for the set of mutations introduced in each clone. In particular, the mutational categories in the feature matrix should correspond to the mutational categories used in the signature matrix. \nPhySigs automatically computes the count matrix, as it is simply a diagonal matrix containing the sum of columns in the feature matrix. PhySigs then solves the Tree-constrained Exposure (TE) problem for all possible clusterings of the clones that correspond to a partition of the phylogeny. The output of the TE problem is a relative exposure matrix composed of groups of identical columns corresponding to clusters of clones with identical exposures (denoted by blue and yellow). Edges between these clusters in the phylogeny are interpreted to be where exposure shifts occurred (denoted by a lightning bolt).",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Authors.Distinct mutational processes shape the genomes of the clones comprising a tumor. These processes result in distinct mutational patterns, summarized by a small number of mutational signatures. Current analyses of clone-specific exposures to mutational signatures do not fully incorporate a tumor's evolutionary context, either inferring identical exposures for all tumor clones, or inferring exposures for each clone independently. Here, we introduce the Tree-constrained Exposure problem to infer a small number of exposure shifts along the edges of a given tumor phylogeny. Our algorithm, PhySigs, solves this problem and includes model selection to identify the number of exposure shifts that best explain the data. We validate our approach on simulated data and identify exposure shifts in lung cancer data, including at least one shift with a matching subclonal driver mutation in the mismatch repair pathway. Moreover, we show that our approach enables the prioritization of alternative phylogenies inferred from the same sequencing data.

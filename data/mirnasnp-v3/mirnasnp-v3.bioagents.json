    "description": "A comprehensive database for SNPs and disease-related variations in miRNAs and miRNA targets.\n\nWelcome to the miRNASNP -v3 database.\n\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous and regulatory non-coding RNAs by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. SNPs in pre-miRNAs or target sites will affect miRNA expression or function. miRNASNP is a comprehensive resource of human miRNA-related SNPs, including their effects on target gain and loss.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) related single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease-related variations (DRVs) in miRNAs and miRNA-target binding sites, can affect miRNA functions and/or biogenesis, thus to impact on phenotypes. miRNASNP is a widely used database for miRNA-related SNPs and their effects. Here, we updated it to miRNASNP-v3 (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/miRNASNP/) with tremendous number of SNVs and new features, especially the DRVs data. We analyzed the effects of 7 161 741 SNPs and 505 417 DRVs on 1897 pre-miRNAs (2630 mature miRNAs) and 3′UTRs of 18 152 genes. miRNASNP-v3 provides a one-stop resource for miRNA-related SNVs research with the following functions: (i) explore associations between miRNA-related SNPs/DRVs and diseases; (ii) browse the effects of SNPs/DRVs on miRNA-target binding; (iii) functional enrichment analysis of miRNA target gain/loss caused by SNPs/DRVs; (iv) investigate correlations between drug sensitivity and miRNA expression; (v) inquire expression profiles of miRNAs and their targets in cancers; (vi) browse the effects of SNPs/DRVs on pre-miRNA secondary structure changes; and (vii) predict the effects of user-defined variations on miRNA-target binding or pre-miRNA secondary structure. miRNASNP-v3 is a valuable and long-term supported resource in functional variation screening and miRNA function studies.",

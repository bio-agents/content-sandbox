However, no systematic database exists that comprehensively includes and integrates all research information on these compounds, and valuable information remains scattered across numerous databases and extensive literature reports. Thus, using natural language processing technology, we curated 12,018 food risk components from 152,737 literature reports, 12 authoritative databases, and numerous related regulatory documents. Data on molecular structures, physicochemical properties, chemical taxonomy, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity properties, and physiological targets within the human body were integrated to afford the comprehensive food risk component database (FRCD, http://www.rxnfinder.org/frcd/). We also analyzed the molecular scaffold and chemical diversity, in addition to evaluating the toxicity and biodegradability of the food risk components. The FRCD could be considered a highly promising agent for future food safety studies.",

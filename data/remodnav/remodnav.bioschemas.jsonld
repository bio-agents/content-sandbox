      "sc:description": "REMoDNaV is a velocity based eye movement event detection algorithm that is based on, but extends the adaptive Nyström & Holmqvist algorithm (Nyström & Holmqvist, 2010). It is built to be suitable for both static and dynamic stimulation, and is capable of detecting saccades, post-saccadic oscillations, fixations, and smooth pursuit events. REMoDNaV is especially suitable for data without a trial structure and performs robustly on data with temporally varying noise level.\n\nThis repository contains the raw data, the code to generate summary statistics, and raw figures for the manuscript, and the manuscript sources for the publication REMoDNaV: Robust Eye Movement Detection for Natural Viewing.",

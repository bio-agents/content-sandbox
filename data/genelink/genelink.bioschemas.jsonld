Genetic analyses of complex traits are challenging, and high quality data-management systems are often critical to the success of these projects. So, we have developed it, that enables genotypic data to be merged easily with pedigree and extensive phenotypic data. It was designed specifically to facilitate large-scale, genetic linkage or association studies and is a powerful agent for complex trait mapping.",

IMGT/3Dstructure-DB contains 3D structures of immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, antigen receptor/antigen complexes (IG/Ag, TR/peptide/MHC) of vertebrates; 3D structures of related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates, belonging to the immunoglobulin and MHC superfamilies (IgSF and MhcSF, respectively) and found in complexes with IG, TR or MHC. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB data are annotated according to the IMGT criteria, using IMGT/DomainGapAlign, and based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts and axioms. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification (CLASSIFICATION), region and domain delimitations (DESCRIPTION), amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files. In its Web version, the IMGT/DomainGapAlign agent analyses amino acid sequences, per domain. Coupled to the IMGT/Collier-de-Perles agent, it provides an invaluable help for antibody engineering and humanization design based on complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting as it precisely defines the standardized framework regions (FR-IMGT) and CDR-IMGT.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (http://www.imgt.org) is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. By its creation in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Université de Montpellier and CNRS), IMGT marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. IMGT is specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) and proteins of the IgSF and MhSF superfamilies. IMGT is built on the IMGTONTOLOGY axioms and concepts, which bridged the gap between genes, sequences and 3D structures. The concepts include the IMGTR standardized keywords (identification), IMGTR standardized labels (description), IMGTR standardized nomenclature (classification), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles (numerotation). IMGTR comprises 7 databases, 17 online agents and 15 000 pages of web resources, and provides a high-quality and integrated system for analysis of the genomic and expressed IG and TR repertoire of the adaptive immune responses, including NGS high-throughput data. Agents and databases are used in basic, veterinary and medical research, in clinical applications (mutation analysis in leukemia and lymphoma) and in antibody engineering and humanization. The IMGT/mAb-DB interface was developed for therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins for immunological applications (FPIA). IMGTR is freely available at http://www.imgt.org.",

      "sc:description": "Targeted realignment of LC-MS profiles by neighbor-wise compound-specific graphical time warping with misalignment detection.\n\nThe purpose of ncGTW is to detect and fix the bad alignments in the LC-MS data. Currently, ncGTW is implemented in a R-package as a plug-in for XCMS. That is, ncGTW can detect the misaligned feature groups from XCMS and realign them. After that, XCMS can use the realigned data from XCMS for more accurate grouping and peak-filling.",

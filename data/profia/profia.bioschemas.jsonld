FIA-HRMS data, however, cannot be pre-processed with current software agents which rely on liquid chromatography separation, or handle low resolution data only. Here we present the package that implements a new methodology to pre-process FIA-HRMS raw data (netCDF, mzData, mzXML, and mzML) and generates the peak table.",

description: Ms-gf+ is a new ms/ms database search agent that is sensitive (it identifies
  more peptides than other database search agents and as many peptides as spectral
  library search agents) and universal (works well for diverse types of spectra, different
  configurations of ms instruments and different experimental protocols).

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.mBodyMap is a curated database for microbes across the human body and their associations with health and diseases. Its primary aim is to promote the reusability of human-associated metagenomic data and assist with the identification of disease-associated microbes by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-the-art agentsets and manually curating the meta-data of corresponding human hosts. mBodyMap organizes collected samples based on their association with human diseases and body sites to enable cross-dataset integration and comparison. To help users find microbes of interest and visualize and compare their distributions and abundances/prevalence within different body sites and various diseases, the mBodyMap database is equipped with an intuitive interface and extensive graphical representations of the collected data. So far, it contains a total of 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomes and 48 747 amplicons related to health and 56 human diseases, from within 22 human body sites across 136 projects. Also available in the database are pre-computed abundances and prevalence of 6247 species (belonging to 1645 genera) stratified by body sites and diseases. mBodyMap can be accessed at: https://mbodymap.microbiome.cloud.",

  long_description: " TIDDIT is a agent to used to identify chromosomal rearrangements\
    \ using\n Mate Pair or Paired End sequencing data. TIDDIT identifies intra and\
    \ inter-\n chromosomal translocations, deletions, tandem-duplications and\n inversions,\
    \ using supplementary alignments as well as discordant pairs.\n .\n TIDDIT has\
    \ two analysis modules. The sv mode, which is used to search\n for structural\
    \ variants. And the cov mode that analyse the read depth of\n a bam file and generates\

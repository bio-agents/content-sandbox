                "abstract": "© 2021 Chinese Medical Association. All rights reserved.Objective To develop an R script that can efficiently and accurately filter genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from the GWAS Catalog Website. Methods The selection principles of GWASs were established based on previous studies. The process of manual filtering in the GWAS Catalog was abstracted as standard algorithms. The R script (gwasfilter.R) was written by two programmers and tested many times. Results It takes six steps for gwasfilter.R to filter GWASs. There are five main self-defined functions among this R script. GWASs can be filtered based on \"whether the GWAS has been replicated\" \"sample size\" \"ethnicity of the study population\" and other conditions. It takes no more than 1 second for this script to filter GWASs of a single trait. Conclusions This R script (gwasfilter.R) is user-friendly and provides an efficient and standard process to filter GWASs flexibly. The source code is available at github (https://github.com/lab319/gwas_filter).",

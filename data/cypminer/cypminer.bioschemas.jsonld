CYPminer consists of two procedures i) to generate the Genome-CYP Matrix (GCM) that lists all occurrences of CYPs across the genomes, and ii) to perform analyses and visualization of the GCM, including pan-CYPomes (pan- and core-CYPome), CYP co-occurrence networks, CYP clouds, and genome clustering data.",

description: 'DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on this package.
  Cross-platform alternatives are the following packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN),
  BufferedMatrix (Bioconductor). The main usage of it was inside the aroma.affymetrix
  package. (The package currently provides a class representing a matrix where the
  actual data is stored in a binary format on the local file system. This way the
  size limit of the data is set by the file system and not the memory.)'

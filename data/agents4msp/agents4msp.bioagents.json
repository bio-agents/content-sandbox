The suite was initially developed within the ADRIPLAN data portal, that has been recently upgraded into the Agents4MSP Geoplatform (data.agents4msp.eu), an integrated web platform that supports MSP through the application of different agents, e.g., collaborative geospatial modelling of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) and marine use conflict (MUC) analysis. The package can be used as stand-alone library or as collaborative webagent, providing user- friendly interfaces appropriate to decision-makers, regional authorities, academics and MSP stakeholders. An effective MSP-oriented integrated system of web-based software, users and services is proposed. It includes four components: the Agents4MSP Geoplatform for interoperable and collaborative sharing of geospatial datasets and for MSP-oriented analysis, the Agents4MSP package as stand-alone library for advanced geospatial and statistical analysis, the desktop applications to simplify data curation and the third party data repositories for multidisciplinary and multilevel geospatial datasets integration. The paper presents an application example of the Agents4MSP GeoNode plugin and an example of Agents4MSP stand-alone library for CEA in the Adriatic Sea. The Agents4MSP and the developed software have been released as FOSS under the GPL 3 license and are currently under further development.",

      "sc:description": "Predicting protein subcellular location using learned distributed representations from a protein-protein network | Predicting protein subcellular location using node embedding | we present a deep learning based method, node2loc, to predict protein subcellular location. node2loc first learns distributed representations of proteins in a protein-protein network, which acquires representations from unlabeled data for downstream tasks. Then the learned representations are further fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict subcellular locations | To identify the functions of a protein, we first need know where this protein is located. Interacting proteins tend to locate in the same subcellular location. Thus, it is imperative to take the protein-protein interactions into account for computational identification of protein subcellular locations",

description: NGScopy provides a quantitative caller for detecting copy number variations
  in next generation sequencing (NGS), including whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole
  exome sequencing (WES) and targeted panel sequencing (TPS). The caller can be parallelized
  by chromosomes to use multiple processors/cores on one computer.

      "sc:description": "ctcRbase is agene expression database of circulating tumor cells and microemboli Circulating tumor cells/microemboli (CTCs/CTM) are those cells that depart from cancerous lesions and shed into the bloodstream. Enumeration and analysis of CTCs/CTM may enable non-invasive monitoring of advanced cancers, as well as early detection of tumor metastases. ctcRbase (Gene expression database of circulating tumor cells/ microemboli) is a database to collect expression data of CTCs and CTM in all kinds of cancer types, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from RNA-seq data analyses. ctcRbase provides the expression level of primary tumors, CTCs/CTM and white blood cells (WBC). Moreover, the expression level of tumor metastasis was also provided. An easy-to-use interface was constructed to query and browse gene expression in CTCs/CTM.",

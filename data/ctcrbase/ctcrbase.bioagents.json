    "description": "ctcRbase is agene expression database of circulating tumor cells and microemboli Circulating tumor cells/microemboli (CTCs/CTM) are those cells that depart from cancerous lesions and shed into the bloodstream. Enumeration and analysis of CTCs/CTM may enable non-invasive monitoring of advanced cancers, as well as early detection of tumor metastases. ctcRbase (Gene expression database of circulating tumor cells/ microemboli) is a database to collect expression data of CTCs and CTM in all kinds of cancer types, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from RNA-seq data analyses. ctcRbase provides the expression level of primary tumors, CTCs/CTM and white blood cells (WBC). Moreover, the expression level of tumor metastasis was also provided. An easy-to-use interface was constructed to query and browse gene expression in CTCs/CTM.",

Analysis of CTCs can allow the investigation of tumor cell biomarker expression from a non-invasive liquid biopsy. To date, high-throughput technologies have become a powerful agent to provide a genome-wide view of transcriptomic changes associated with CTCs/CTMs. These data provided us much information to understand the tumor heterogeneity, and the underlying molecular mechanism of tumor metastases. Unfortunately, these data have been deposited into various repositories, and a uniform resource for the cancer metastasis is still unavailable. To this end, we integrated previously published transcriptome datasets of CTCs/CTMs and constructed a web-accessible database. The first release of ctcRbase contains 526 CTCs/CTM samples across seven cancer types. The expression of 14 631 mRNAs and 3642 long non-coding RNAs of CTCs/CTMs were included. Experimental validations from the published literature are also included. Since CTCs/CTMs are considered to be precursors of metastases, ctcRbase also collected the expression data of primary tumors and metastases, which allows user to discover a unique 'circulating tumor cell gene signature' that is distinct from primary tumor and metastases. An easy-to-use database was constructed to query and browse CTCs/CTMs genes. ctcRbase can be freely accessible at http://www.origin-gene.cn/database/ctcRbase/.",

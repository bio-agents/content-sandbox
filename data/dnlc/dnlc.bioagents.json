Functional relations between genes can be activated or deactivated depending on the biological conditions. On the genome-scale network, subnetworks that gain or lose local expression consistency may shed light on the regulatory mechanisms related to the changing biological conditions, such as disease status or tissue developmental stages. Results: In this study, we develop a new method to select genes and modules on the existing biological network, in which local expression consistency changes significantly between clinical conditions. The method is called DNLC: Differential Network Local Consistency. In simulations, our algorithm detected artificially created local consistency changes effectively. We applied the method on two publicly available datasets, and the method detected novel genes and network modules that were biologically plausible. Conclusions: The new method is effective in finding modules in which the gene expression consistency change between clinical conditions. It is a useful agent that complements traditional differential expression analyses to make discoveries from gene expression data.

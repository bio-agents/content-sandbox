However, often times when building models, portions of these features are missing for a subset of the dataset. We provide a modeling framework to effectively integrate this type of heterogeneous data to improve prediction accuracy. To test our methodology, we have stacked data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to increase the accuracy of drug sensitivity prediction. The package addresses the dynamic regime of information integration involving sequential addition of features and samples.",

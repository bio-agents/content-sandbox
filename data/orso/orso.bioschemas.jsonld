ORSO performs this task by creating and maintaining a network of datasets connected based on similarity in primary read coverage values and annotated metadata. An ORSO user can follow these connections to discover datasets with similar characteristics. ORSO is also a social network. Users may favorite datasets and follow other users, creating new connections that influence how datasets are recommended.",

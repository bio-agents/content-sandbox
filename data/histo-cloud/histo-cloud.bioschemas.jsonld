HistomicsTK is a Python package for the analysis of digital pathology images. It can function as a stand-alone library, or as a Digital Slide Archive plugin that allows users to invoke image analysis jobs through HistomicsUI. The functionality offered by HistomicsTK can be extended using slicer cli web which allows developers to integrate their image analysis algorithms into DSA for dissemination through HistomicsUI.",

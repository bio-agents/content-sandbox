                "abstract": "© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Cell-penetrating anticancer peptides (Cp-ACPs) are considered promising candidates in solid tumor and hematologic cancer therapies. Current approaches for the design and discovery of Cp-ACPs trust the expensive high-throughput screenings that often give rise to multiple obstacles, including instrumentation adaptation and experimental handling. The application of machine learning (ML) agents developed for peptide activity prediction is importantly of growing interest. In this study, we applied the random forest (RF)-, support vector machine (SVM)-, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based algorithms to predict the active Cp-ACPs using an experimentally validated data set. The model, CpACpP, was developed on the basis of two independent cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and anticancer peptide (ACP) subpredictors. Various compositional and physiochemical-based features were combined or selected using the multilayered recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for both data sets. Our results showed that the ACP subclassifiers obtain a mean performance accuracy (ACC) of 0.98 with an area under curve (AUC) ≈ 0.98 vis-à-vis the CPP predictors displaying relevant values of ∼0.94 and ∼0.95 via the hybrid-based features and independent data sets, respectively. Also, the predicting evaluation of Cp-ACPs gave accuracies of ∼0.79 and 0.89 on a series of independent sequences by applying our CPP and ACP classifiers, respectively, which leaves the performance of our predictors better than the earlier reported ACPred, mACPpred, MLCPP, and CPPred-RF. The described consensus-based fusion method additionally reached an AUC of 0.94 for the prediction of Cp-ACP (http://cbb1.ut.ac.ir/CpACpP/Index).",

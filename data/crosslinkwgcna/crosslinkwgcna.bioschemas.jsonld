      "sc:description": "The crosslinkWGCNA web agent provides a user-friendly interface to the popular Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R package. Users are able to upload their data sets and subsequently apply the standard workflow steps using a project-based structure and an easy to navigate interface. Along the way, the agent provides multiple familiar visualizations such as the hierarchically clustered genes with color-coded clusters, a similar tree for the samples and sample traits, module-trait correlations, and more. In addition, the agent allows for integrating multiple WGCNA projects using a correlation-based approach. Both data and visualizations can be exported",

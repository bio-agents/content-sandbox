      "sc:description": "PPAI is a web server for predicting protein-aptamer interactions.\n\nThe interactions between proteins and aptamers are prevalent in organisms and play an important role in various life activities. Thanks to the rapid accumulation of protein-aptamer interaction data, it is very important and feasible to construct an accurate computational model to predict protein-aptamer interactions, which is benefit for understanding mechanisms of protein-aptamer interactions and improving aptamer-based therapies.\n\nPPAI is a novel web-server to predict aptamers and protein-aptamer interactions with sequence features of proteins/aptamers and machine learning framework which integrated Adaboost and Random Forest. PPAI not only provides more accurate prediction functions, but also provides the protein aptamer information to the user for query.",

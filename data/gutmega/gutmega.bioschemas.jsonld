      "sc:description": "a database of the human gut MEtaGenome Atlas.\n\nRecently numerous studies have identified that the perturbations in the gut microbiome were associated with human health, including diseases and cancers, even mental health. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing based metagenomics technologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon-based and genome-centric approaches have burst the profiling of the landscape for gut microbiome and the identification of human health related microbes. Here, we presented the gutMEGA database, which hosted the results of metagenomics studies.",

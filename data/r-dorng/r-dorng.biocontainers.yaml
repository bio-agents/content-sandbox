description: This package provides functions to perform reproducible parallel foreach
  loops, using independent random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive
  generator [L'Ecuyer (1999)]. It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops
  into fully reproducible loops, independently of the number of workers, the task
  scheduling strategy, or the chosen parallel environment and associated foreach backend.

                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2018.Biomedical data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) enable the search and discovery of relevant biomedical digital data objects. Similarly, resources such as OMICagents, index bioinformatics agents that can extract knowledge from these digital data objects. However, systematic access to pre-generated 'canned' analyses applied by bioinformatics agents to biomedical digital data objects is currently not available. Datasets2Agents is a repository indexing 31,473 canned bioinformatics analyses applied to 6,431 datasets. The Datasets2Agents repository also contains the indexing of 4,901 published bioinformatics software agents, and all the analyzed datasets. Datasets2Agents enables users to rapidly find datasets, agents, and canned analyses through an intuitive web interface, a Google Chrome extension, and an API. Furthermore, Datasets2Agents provides a platform for contributing canned analyses, datasets, and agents, as well as evaluating these digital objects according to their compliance with the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles. By incorporating community engagement, Datasets2Agents promotes sharing of digital resources to stimulate the extraction of knowledge from biomedical research data.

                "abstract": "© 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.The two Bayesian adaptive psychometric methods named QUEST (Watson & Pelli, 1983) and QUEST+ (Watson, 2017) are widely used to estimate psychometric parameters, especially the threshold, in laboratory-based psychophysical experiments. Considering the increase of online psychophysical experiments in recent years, there is a growing need to have the QUEST and QUEST+ methods available online as well. We developed JavaScript libraries for both, with this article introducing one of them: jsQuestPlus. We offer integrations with online experimental agents such as jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015), PsychoPy/JS (Peirce et al., 2019), and lab.js (Henninger et al., 2021). We measured the computation time required by jsQuestPlus under four conditions. Our simulations on 37 browser–computer combinations showed that the mean initialization time was 461.08 ms, 95% CI [328.29, 593.87], the mean computation time required to determine the stimulus parameters for the next trial was less than 1 ms, and the mean update time was 79.39 ms, 95% CI [46.22, 112.55] even in extremely demanding conditions. Additionally, psychometric parameters were estimated as accurately as the original QUEST+ method did. We conclude that jsQuestPlus is fast and accurate enough to conduct online psychophysical experiments despite the complexity of the matrix calculations.

                "abstract": "© 2017 American Chemical Society.Micelles play an important role in both experimental and computational studies of the effect of lipid interactions on biological systems. The spherical geometry and the dynamical behavior of micelles makes generating micelle structures for use in molecular simulations challenging. An easy agent for generating simulation-ready micelle models, covering a broad range of lipids, is highly desirable. Here, we present a new Web server, Micelle Maker, which can provide equilibrated micelle models as a direct input for subsequent molecular dynamics simulations from a broad range of lipids (currently 25 lipid types, including 24 glycolipids). The Web server, which is available at http://www.micellemaker.net, uses error checking routines to prevent clashes during the initial placement of the lipids and uses AMBER's GLYCAM library for generating minimized or equilibrated micelle models, but the resulting structures can be used as starting points for simulations with any force field or simulation package. Extensive validation simulations with an overall simulation time of 12 μs using eight micelle models where assembly information is available show that all of the micelles remain very stable over the whole simulation time. Finally, we discuss the advantages of Micelle Maker relative to other approaches in the field.",

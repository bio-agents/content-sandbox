Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, and Hits) are implemented in the package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges package and in other BioConductor infrastructure packages).",

This readme only covers the practical matters of executing the pipeline. Please see the wiki or FAQ for more detailed discussions and tutorials covering how to use a VCFdb once it is created.\n\nVCFdbR was designed with Linux-based high performance computing clusters in mind, but it should work on any distro. It has not been tested on Windows or Mac operating systems, and changes to specifically support them are not planned.",

Sequences must be in the arc-annotated format: first line starts with > and following is the sequence header. Next line is the RNA Sequence and then the secondary structure inforamtion. You can add multitude sequences at the same time. The sequences will be added to the list in the side menu.\n\nTo delete sequences, you can click on those you want deleted and click the \"Delete selected\" button to remove them. If you want to clear the whole list, the button \"Delete all\" will do it. The buttons \"Select All\" and \"Unselect All\" are used to make this easier when working with multiple sequences",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Background: It is now well established that eukaryotic coding genes have the ability to produce more than one type of transcript thanks to the mechanisms of alternative splicing and alternative transcription. Because of the lack of gold standard real data on alternative splicing, simulated data constitute a good option for evaluating the accuracy and the efficiency of methods developed for splice-aware sequence analysis. However, existing sequence evolution simulation methods do not model alternative splicing, and so they can not be used to test spliced sequence analysis methods. Results: We propose a new method called SimSpliceEvol for simulating the evolution of sets of alternative transcripts along the branches of an input gene tree. In addition to traditional sequence evolution events, the simulation also includes gene exon-intron structure evolution events and alternative splicing events that modify the sets of transcripts produced from genes. SimSpliceEvol was implemented in Python. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/UdeS-CoBIUS/SimSpliceEvol. Conclusions: Data generated using SimSpliceEvol are useful for testing spliced RNA sequence analysis methods such as methods for spliced alignment of cDNA and genomic sequences, multiple cDNA alignment, orthologous exons identification, splicing orthology inference, transcript phylogeny inference, which requires to know the real evolutionary relationships between the sequences.",

      "sc:description": "alternative splicing-aware simulation of biological sequence evolution.\n\nTo add a sequence you need to click the \"Add sequence\" button is the top left corner of the main application screen. Sequences must be in the arc-annotated format: first line starts with > and following is the sequence header. Next line is the RNA Sequence and then the secondary structure inforamtion. You can add multitude sequences at the same time. The sequences will be added to the list in the side menu.\n\nTo delete sequences, you can click on those you want deleted and click the \"Delete selected\" button to remove them. If you want to clear the whole list, the button \"Delete all\" will do it. The buttons \"Select All\" and \"Unselect All\" are used to make this easier when working with multiple sequences",

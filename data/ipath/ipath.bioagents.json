Based on functional annotations (such as KEGG), it provides pathway maps for primary cellular metabolism as well as for some additional secondary metabolite synthesis and regulatory pathways. Users can map their own data onto these pathway maps. Due to its navigation and customization functions, iPATH allows users to easily explore and analyze the functional and metabolic capabilities of their (meta-)genomic data sets.",

Its primary map summarizes the metabolism in biological systems as annotated to date. Nodes in the map correspond to various chemical compounds and edges represent series of enzymatic reactions. In two other maps, iPath2.0 provides an overview of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and a hand-picked selection of important regulatory pathways and other functional modules, allowing a more general overview of protein functions in a genome or metagenome. iPath2.0′s main interface is an interactive Flash-based viewer, which allows users to easily navigate and explore the complex pathway maps. In addition to the default pre-computed overview maps, iPath offers several data mapping agents. Users can upload various types of data and completely customize all nodes and edges of iPath2.0′s maps. These customized maps give users an intuitive overview of their own data, guiding the analysis of various genomics and metagenomics projects. © 2011 The Author(s).",

Users can fully customize these networks and interactively explore them through its redesigned, fast and lightweight interface, which highlights general metabolic trends in multi-omics data. It also offers navigation at various levels of details to help users further investigate those trends and ultimately uncover novel biological insights.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Circular RNAs (circRNA) are a unique class of transcripts that can only be identified from sequence alignments spanning discordant junctions, commonly referred to as backsplice junctions (BSJ). Canonical splicing is also linked with circRNA biogenesis either from the parental transcript or internal to the circRNA, and is not fully utilized in circRNA software. Here we present Ularcirc, a software agent that integrates the visualization of both BSJ and forward splicing junctions and provides downstream analysis of selected circRNA candidates. Ularcirc utilizes the output of CIRI, circExplorer, or raw chimeric output of the STAR aligner and assembles BSJ count table to allow multi-sample analysis. We used Ularcirc to identify and characterize circRNA from public and in-house generated data sets and demonstrate how it can be used to (i) discover novel splicing patterns of parental transcripts, (ii) detect internal splicing patterns of circRNA, and (iii) reveal the complexity of BSJ formation. Furthermore, we identify circRNA that have potential open reading frames longer than their linear sequence. Finally, we detected and validated the presence of a novel class of circRNA generated from ApoA4 transcripts whose BSJ derive from multiple non-canonical splicing sites within coding exons.

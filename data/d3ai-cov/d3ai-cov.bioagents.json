All rights reserved.Target prediction and virtual screening are two powerful agents of computer-aided drug design. Target identification is of great significance for hit discovery, lead optimization, drug repurposing and elucidation of the mechanism. Virtual screening can improve the hit rate of drug screening to shorten the cycle of drug discovery and development. Therefore, target prediction and virtual screening are of great importance for developing highly effective drugs against COVID-19. Here we present D3AI-CoV, a platform for target prediction and virtual screening for the discovery of anti-COVID-19 drugs. The platform is composed of three newly developed deep learning-based models i.e., MultiDTI, MPNNs-CNN and MPNNs-CNN-R models. To compare the predictive performance of D3AI-CoV with other methods, an external test set, named Test-78, was prepared, which consists of 39 newly published independent active compounds and 39 inactive compounds from DrugBank. For target prediction, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of MultiDTI and MPNNs-CNN models are 0.93 and 0.91, respectively, whereas the AUCs of the other reported approaches range from 0.51 to 0.74. For virtual screening, the hit rate of D3AI-CoV is also better than other methods. D3AI-CoV is available for free as a web application at http://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/D3AI-CoV/index.php, which can serve as a rapid online agent for predicting potential targets for active compounds and for identifying active molecules against a specific target protein for COVID-19 treatment.",

                "abstract": "The original PRIDE Converter agent greatly simplified the process of submitting mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to the PRIDE database. However, after much user feedback, it was noted that the agent had some limitations and could not handle several user requirements that were now becoming commonplace. This prompted us to design and implement a whole new suite of agents that would build on the successes of the original PRIDE Converter and allow users to generate submissionready, well-annotated PRIDE XML files. The PRIDE Converter 2 agent suite allows users to convert search result files into PRIDE XML (the format needed for performing submissions to the PRIDE database), generate mzTab skeleton files that can be used as a basis to submit quantitative and gel-based MS data, and post-process PRIDE XML files by filtering out contaminants and empty spectra, or by merging several PRIDE XML files together. All the agents have both a graphical user interface that provides a dialog-based, user-friendly way to convert and prepare files for submission, as well as a command-line interface that can be used to integrate the agents into existing or novel pipelines, for batch processing and power users. The PRIDE Converter 2 agent suite will thus become a cornerstone in the submission process to PRIDE and, by extension, to the ProteomeXchange consortium of MS-proteomics data repositories.

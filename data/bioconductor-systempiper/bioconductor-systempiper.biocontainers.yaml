description: R package for building and running automated end-to-end analysis workflows
  for a wide range of ngs applications such as rna-seq, chip-seq, var-seq and ribo-seq.
  important features include a uniform workflow interface across them, automated report
  generation, and support for running both r and command-line software, such as ngs
  aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters.

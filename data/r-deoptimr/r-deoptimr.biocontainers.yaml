description: Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global optimization
  of problems with and without constraints. The aim is to curate a collection of its
  state-of-the-art variants that (1) do not sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are
  essentially tuning-free, and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the
  R language. Currently, it only provides an implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm

In its current release, only pathogen sequencing application is implemented. In pathogen studies utilizing next generation sequencing, investigators ofte n collect samples naturally as pools of multiple strains, e.g., when the samples are taken from patientsâ€™ blood. To analyze these types of within-host polymorphisms, one would ideally like to determine the haplotypes in the sample.",

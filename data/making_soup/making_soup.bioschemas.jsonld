      "sc:description": "Preparing and Validating Molecular Simulations of the Bacterial Cytoplasm.\n\nThe cytoplasm of a cell is sometimes jestingly called a Soup, since it contains many different ingredients. Indeed there is quite a bit of salt and glutamate, the well known flavour enhancing compoud that is used a lot in asian kitchen but also in broth. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_flavoring.\n\nIn order to study the cytoplasm of a cell one can use a variety of experimental biochemistry techniques, but also computer simulations, which is the focus of this page. Here we thererfore provide information and python scripts to run computer simulations using http://www.gromacs.org of (quite) realistic models of the cytoplasm.\n\nThe main work is done here by a few scripts, located in the aptly named scripts directory. They are described briefly in the README.md in that directory",

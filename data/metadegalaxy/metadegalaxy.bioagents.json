                "abstract": "Â© 2019 Thang MWC et al.Metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly common agent in environmental and biomedical sciences. While software for detailing the composition of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker genes is relatively mature, increasingly researchers are interested in identifying changes exhibited within microbial communities under differing environmental conditions. In order to gain maximum value from metagenomic sequence data we must improve the existing analysis environment by providing accessible and scalable computational workflows able to generate reproducible results. Here we describe a complete end-to-end open-source metagenomics workflow running within Galaxy for 16S differential abundance analysis. The workflow accepts 454 or Illumina sequence data (either overlapping or non-overlapping paired end reads) and outputs lists of the operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) exhibiting the greatest change under differing conditions. A range of analysis steps and graphing options are available giving users a high-level of control over their data and analyses. Additionally, users are able to input complex sample-specific metadata information which can be incorporated into differential analysis and used for grouping/colouring within graphs. Detailed tutorials containing sample data and existing workflows are available for three different input types: Overlapping and non-overlapping read pairs as well as for pre-generated Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) files. Using the Galaxy platform we developed MetaDEGalaxy, a complete metagenomics differential abundance analysis workflow. MetaDEGalaxy is designed for bench scientists working with 16S data who are interested in comparative metagenomics. MetaDEGalaxy builds on momentum within the wider Galaxy metagenomics community with the hope that more agents will be added as existing methods mature.",

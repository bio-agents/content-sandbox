      "sc:description": "Anchored DIALIGN is a WWW server for multiple alignment of protein and nucleic acid sequences using DIALIGN with user-defined anchor points.Alignments can be created either fully automatically or by using a list of user-defined constraints. By specifying such anchor points, the user can force the program to align selected segments of the sequences to each other. The remaining parts of the sequences are then aligned automatically, respecting the constraints imposed by the selected anchor points.",

      "sc:description": "pCysMod is a agent for the prediction of multiple cysteine modification based on deep learning framework. Protein cysteine modifications mainly include thiol oxidation and palmitoylation of thioesterification reaction, which lead to a cascade of biochemical reactions. There are many types of cysteine modifications mediated by thiol groups, such as S-nitrosylation, S-sulfhydration, S-sulfenylation and S-sulfinylation. Besides, S-palmitoylation is cysteine modification through thioesterification reaction. These modifications lead to a cascade of biochemical reactions, and regulate various physiological and pathological processes, such as autophagy, redox homeostasis and cell signaling, demonstrating a closely relationship with many human diseases including cancers and diabetes and so on.",

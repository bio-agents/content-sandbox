    "description": "Proteomic analysis of serum antibodies web server.\n\nPASA allows generating quantitative and qualitative molecular measurements related to serum antibody repertoire from high-resolution proteomic data. PASA is applicable for researchers at all levels that are interested in addressing basic questions related to B cell development and differentiation, as well as an application focused agent for vaccine development, immunodiagnostic discovery and monoclonal antibody engineering. The web server accepts proteomics spectral files (in '.raw' format), and requires (at least) two technical replicates of each fraction (elution and flow-through).

The proteomic analysis is challenging since it necessitates the mapping of antigen-specific peptides to individual B-cell clones. Results The PASA web server provides a robust computational platform for the analysis and integration of data obtained from proteomics of serum antibodies. PASA maps peptides derived from antibodies raised against a specific antigen to corresponding antibody sequences. It then analyzes and integrates proteomics and BCR-Seq data, thus providing a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response.

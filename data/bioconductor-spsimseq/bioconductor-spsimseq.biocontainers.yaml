description: SPsimSeq uses a specially designed exponential family for density estimation
  to constructs the distribution of gene expression levels from a given real RNA sequencing
  data (single-cell or bulk), and subsequently simulates a new dataset from the estimated
  marginal distributions using Gaussian-copulas to retain the dependence between genes.
  It allows simulation of multiple groups and batches with any required sample size
  and library size.

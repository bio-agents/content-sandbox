  "sc:description": "VariantSpark is a tailored Apache Spark-based machine learning framework that creates insights from high-dimensional data, including genomics and clinical data. VariantSparkâ€™s machine learning method overcomes the limitation of traditional approaches that requires data to be eliminated or identifying only independent markers. Especially complex events are triggered by multiple contributing factors. VariantSpark is able to detect such sets of interacting features thereby identifying more accurate predictive markers. VariantSpark builds on the Random Forest Machine Learning method, which allows to interrogate the tree-based models and identify which features contributed in what proportion to the overall prediction outcome. We also provide a visualization engine that shows the interplay between features and their label association.",

description: Implements a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model
  that can be used to provide a low-dimensional representations of single-cell rna-seq
  data. the model accounts for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the
  count nature of the data. the model also accounts for the difference in library
  sizes and optionally for batch effects and/or other covariates, avoiding the need
  for pre-normalize the data.

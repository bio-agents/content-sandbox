    "description": "DNAr is a R package developed to design and simulate formal Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and DNA-based reaction networks using Strand Displacement reactions. The theoretical field of Chemical Kinetics has developed brightly the last years, being capable of design many circuits and algorithms (such as the Message Passing Inference and a Least mean Squares Estimator) using CRNs as a building block.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) have been proposed as an abstraction for molecular computing. DNA strand displacement (DSD) reactions are good candidates to realize this endeavor, since DNA strands can be wired to implement the desired dynamic behavior in a test tube. Specialists use simulators to help them design such chemical systems before experimental implementation. In this sense, we present the DNAr package, an alternative open-source agent, developed in R language, for users from multidisciplinary areas. The current version of our agent offers functions to simulate CRNs, convert a formal CRN into a DSD network, interpret results, export to Visual DSD, and create libraries. Here, we use the consensus CRN to show DNAr features and a neural network model to demonstrate scalability, simulating more than 600 chemical reactions in a few minutes.",

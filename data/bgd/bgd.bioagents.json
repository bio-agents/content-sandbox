Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Bovine Genome Database (BGD) (http://bovinegenome.org) has been the key community bovine genomics database for more than a decade. To accommodate the increasing amount and complexity of bovine genomics data, BGD continues to advance its practices in data acquisition, curation, integration and efficient data retrieval. BGD provides agents for genome browsing (JBrowse), genome annotation (Apollo), data mining (BovineMine) and sequence database searching (BLAST). To augment the BGD genome annotation capabilities, we have developed a new Apollo plug-in, called the Locus-Specific Alternate Assembly (LSAA) agent, which enables users to identify and report potential genome assembly errors and structural variants. BGD now hosts both the newest bovine reference genome assembly, ARS-UCD1.2, as well as the previous reference genome, UMD3.1.1, with cross-genome navigation and queries supported in JBrowse and BovineMine, respectively. Other notable enhancements to BovineMine include the incorporation of genomes and gene annotation datasets for non-bovine ruminant species (goat and sheep), support for multiple assemblies per organism in the Regions Search agent, integration of additional ontologies and development of many new template queries. To better serve the research community, we continue to focus on improving existing agents, developing new agents, adding new datasets and encouraging researchers to use these resources.",

BGD includes GBrowse genome browsers, the Apollo Annotation Editor, a quantitative trait loci (QTL) viewer, BLAST databases and gene pages. Genome browsers, available for both scaffold and chromosome coordinate systems, display the bovine Official Gene Set (OGS), RefSeq and Ensembl gene models, non-coding RNA, repeats, pseudogenes, singlenucleotide polymorphism, markers, QTL and alignments to complementary DNAs, ESTs and protein homologs. The Bovine QTL viewer is connected to the BGD Chromosome GBrowse, allowing for the identification of candidate genes underlying QTL. The Apollo Annotation Editor connects directly to the BGD Chado database to provide researchers with remote access to gene evidence in a graphical interface that allows editing and creating new gene models. Researchers may upload their annotations to the BGD server for review and integration into the subsequent release of the OGS. Gene pages display information for individual OGS gene models, including gene structure, transcript variants, functional descriptions, gene symbols, Gene Ontology terms, annotator comments and links to National Center for Biotechnology Information and Ensembl. Each gene page is linked to a wiki page to allow input from the research community. © The Author(s) 2010.",

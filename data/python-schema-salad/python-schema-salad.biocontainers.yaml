description: Salad is a schema language for describing JSON or YAML structured linked
  data documents. Salad schema describes rules for preprocessing, structural validation,
  and hyperlink checking for documents described by a Salad schema. Salad supports
  rich data modeling with inheritance, template specialization, object identifiers,
  object references, documentation generation, code generation, and transformation
  to RDF. Salad provides a bridge between document and record oriented data modeling
  and the Semantic Web.

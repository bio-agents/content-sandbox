description: 'lRoutines for the analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical
  methods assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are ambiguous
  (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers). The main functions are: haplo.em(),
  haplo.glm(), haplo.score(), and haplo.power(); all of which have detailed examples
  in the vignette.'

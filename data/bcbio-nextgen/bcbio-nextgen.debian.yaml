description: This package installs the command line agents of the bcbio-nextgen agentkit
  implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high throughput sequencing
  analysis. . A high-level configuration file specifies inputs and analysis parameters
  to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution, idempotent processing
  restarts and safe transactional steps. The project contributes a shared community
  resource that handles the data processing component of sequencing analysis, providing
  researchers with more time to focus on the downstream biology. . This package builds
  and having it in Debian unstable helps the Debian developers to synchronize their
  efforts. But unless a series of external dependencies are not installed manually,
  amongst which for instance is the agent mosdepth for which much of the nim and go
  libraries still need to be brought to Debian to make it compile, or also vienna-rna,
  the functionality of bcbio in Debian is only a shadow of itself. Please use the
  official distribution of bcbio for the time being, which means "use conda".

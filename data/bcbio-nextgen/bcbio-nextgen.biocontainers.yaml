description: Python scripts and modules for automated next gen sequencing analysis.
  these provide a fully automated pipeline for taking sequencing results from an illumina
  sequencer, converting them to standard fastq format, aligning to a reference genome,
  doing snp calling, and producing a summary pdf of results.

  description: agentkit for analysing high-throughput sequencing data
  long_description: " This package installs the command line agents of the bcbio-nextgen\n\
    \ agentkit implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high\n throughput\
    \ sequencing analysis.\n .\n A high-level configuration file specifies inputs\
    \ and analysis parameters\n to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed\
    \ execution,\n idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps.  The\
    \ project\n contributes a shared community resource that handles the data processing\n\
    \ component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time\n to\
    \ focus on the downstream biology.\n .\n This package builds and having it in\
    \ Debian unstable helps the Debian\n developers to synchronize their efforts.\
    \ But unless a series of external\n dependencies are not installed manually, amongst\
    \ which for instance\n is the agent mosdepth for which much of the nim and go libraries\
    \ still\n need to be brought to Debian to make it compile, or also vienna-rna,\n\
    \ the functionality of bcbio in Debian is only a shadow of itself. Please\n use\
    \ the official distribution of bcbio for the time being, which means\n \"use conda\"\
    .\n"

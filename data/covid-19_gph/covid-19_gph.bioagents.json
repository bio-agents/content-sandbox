                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).The scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an abundance of publications, including peer-reviewed articles and preprints, across a wide array of disciplines, from microbiology to medicine and social sciences. Genomics and precision health (GPH) technologies have had a particularly prominent role in medical and public health investigations and response; however, these domains are not simply defined and it is difficult to search for relevant information using traditional strategies. To quantify and track the ongoing contributions of GPH to the COVID-19 response, the Office of Genomics and Precision Public Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the COVID-19 Genomics and Precision Health database (COVID-19 GPH), an open access knowledge management system and publications database that is continuously updated through machine learning and manual curation. As of February 11, 2022, COVID-GPH contained 31,597 articles, mostly on pathogen and human genomics (72%). The database also includes articles describing applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to the investigation and control of COVID-19 (28%). COVID-GPH represents about 10% (22983/221241) of the literature on COVID-19 on PubMed. This unique knowledge management database makes it easier to explore, describe, and track how the pandemic response is accelerating the applications of genomics and precision health technologies. COVID-19 GPH can be freely accessed via https://phgkb.cdc.gov/PHGKB/coVInfoStartPage.action.",

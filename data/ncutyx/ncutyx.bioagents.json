    "description": "A package for clustering analysis of multilayer omics data.\n\nClustering of Omics Data of Multiple Types with a Multilayer Network Representation.\n\nOmics data come in different forms: gene expression, methylation, copy number, protein measurements and more. 'NCutYX' allows clustering of variables, of samples, and both variables and samples (biclustering), while incorporating the dependencies across multiple types of Omics data.

We develop NCutYX, an R package for clustering analysis of multilayer omics data. The package and methods jointly analyze multiple layers of omics measurements and effectively accommodate their regulations. They systematically conduct a series of analysis based on the normalized cut technique, including the clusterings of subjects and omics measurements and biclustering. The package can be valuable for its timely context, novel methods and comprehensiveness.",

      "sc:description": "mzRAPP is a agent for reliability assessment of data pre-processing in non-targeted metabolomics. The goal of mzRAPP is to allow reliability assessment of non-targeted data pre-processing (NPP; XCMS, XCMS3, MetaboanalystR 3.0, XCMS-online, MZmine 2, MS-DIAL, OpenMS, El-MAVEN,..) in the realm of liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). mzRAPPs approach is based on the increasing popularity of merging non-targeted with targeted metabolomics meaning that both types of data evaluation are often performed on the same dataset.",

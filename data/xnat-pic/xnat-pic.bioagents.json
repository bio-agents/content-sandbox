                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Molecular imaging generates large volumes of heterogeneous biomedical imagery with an impelling need of guidelines for handling image data. Although several successful solutions have been implemented for human epidemiologic studies, few and limited approaches have been proposed for animal population studies. Preclinical imaging research deals with a variety of machinery yielding tons of raw data but the current practices to store and distribute image data are inadequate. Therefore, standard agents for the analysis of large image datasets need to be established. In this paper, we present an extension of XNAT for Preclinical Imaging Centers (XNAT-PIC). XNAT is a worldwide used, open-source platform for securely hosting, sharing, and processing of clinical imaging studies. Despite its success, neither agents for importing large, multimodal preclinical image datasets nor pipelines for processing whole imaging studies are yet available in XNAT. In order to overcome these limitations, we have developed several agents to expand the XNAT core functionalities for supporting preclinical imaging facilities. Our aim is to streamline the management and exchange of image data within the preclinical imaging community, thereby enhancing the reproducibility of the results of image processing and promoting open science practices.",

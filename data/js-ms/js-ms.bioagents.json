                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry (MS) uses mass-to-charge ratios of measured particles to decode the identities and quantities of molecules in a sample. Interpretation of raw MS depends upon data processing algorithms that render it human-interpretable. Quantitative MS workflows are complex experimental chains and it is crucial to know the performance and bias of each data processing method as they impact accuracy, coverage, and statistical significance of the result. Creation of the ground truth necessary for quantitatively evaluating MS1-aware algorithms is difficult and tedious task, and better software for creating such datasets would facilitate more extensive evaluation and improvement of MS data processing algorithms. RESULTS: We present JS-MS 2.0, a software suite that provides a dependency-free, browser-based, one click, cross-platform solution for creating MS1 ground truth. The software retains the first version's capacity for loading, viewing, and navigating MS1 data in 2- and 3-D, and adds agents for capturing, editing, saving, and viewing isotopic envelope and extracted isotopic chromatogram features. The software can also be used to view and explore the results of feature finding algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: JS-MS 2.0 enables faster creation and inspection of MS1 ground truth data.

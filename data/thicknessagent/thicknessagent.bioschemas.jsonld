      "sc:description": "automated ImageJ retinal layer thickness and profile in digital images.\n\nTo develop an automated retina layer thickness measurement agent for the ImageJ platform, to quantitate nuclear layers following the retina contour. We developed the ThicknessAgent (TT), an automated thickness measurement plugin for the ImageJ platform. To calibrate TT, we created a calibration dataset of mock binary skeletonized mask images with increasing thickness masks and different rotations. Following, we created a training dataset and performed an agreement analysis of thickness measurements between TT and two masked manual observers. Finally, we tested the performance of TT measurements in a validation dataset of retinal detachment images. In the calibration dataset, there were no differences in layer thickness between measured and known thickness masks, with an overall coefficient of variation of 0.00%",

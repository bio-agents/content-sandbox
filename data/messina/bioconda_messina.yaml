description: Messina is a collection of algorithms for constructing optimally robust
  single-gene classifiers, and for identifying differential expression in the presence
  of outliers or unknown sample subgroups.  The methods have application in identifying
  lead features to develop into clinical tests (both diagnostic and prognostic), and
  in identifying differential expression when a fraction of samples show unusual patterns
  of expression.

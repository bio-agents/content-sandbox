Predicting out-of-hospital outcomes upon follow-up remains difficult, and no simple, well-validated agents exist for this population at present. We aim to evaluate several factors in a competing risks model for actionable evaluation of the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in diabetic outpatients following acute coronary syndrome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome in two centres. A Fine–Gray competing risks model was adjusted to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality. A point-based score is presented that is based on this model. Results: Out of the 1400 patients, there were 783 (55.9%) with at least one major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (417 deaths). Of them, 143 deaths were due to non-major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Predictive Fine–Gray models show that the ‘PG-HACKER’ risk factors (gender, age, peripheral arterial disease, left ventricle function, previous congestive heart failure, Killip class and optimal medical therapy) were associated to major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Conclusion: The PG-HACKER score is a simple and effective agent that is freely available and easily accessible to physicians and patients. The PG-HACKER score can predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events following acute coronary syndrome in patients with diabetes.",

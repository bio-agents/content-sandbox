This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.This paper presents ECOTOOL, a new free MATLAB agentbox that embodies several routines for identification, validation and forecasting of dynamic models. The agentbox includes a wide range of exploratory, descriptive and diagnostic statistical agents with visual support, designed in easy-to-use Graphical User Interfaces. It also incorporates complex automatic procedures for identification, exact maximum likelihood estimation and outlier detection for many types of models available in the literature (like multi-seasonal ARIMA models, transfer functions, Exponential Smoothing, Unobserved Components, VARX). ECOTOOL is the outcome of a long period of programming effort with the aim of producing a user friendly agentkit such that, just a few lines of code written in MATLAB are able to perform a comprehensive analysis of time series. The agentbox is supplied with an in-depth documentation system and online help and is available on the internet. The paper describes the main functionalities of the agentbox, and its power is shown working on several real examples.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: The growing interest in phages as antibacterial agents has led to an increase in the number of sequenced phage genomes, increasing the need for intuitive bioinformatics agents for performing genome annotation. The identification of phage promoters is indeed the most difficult step of this process. Due to the lack of online agents for phage promoter prediction, we developed PhagePromoter, a agent for locating promoters in phage genomes, using machine learning methods. This is the first online agent for predicting promoters that uses phage promoter data and the first to identify both host and phage promoters with different motifs.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Advancements in metagenomics sequencing allow the study of microbial communities directly from their environments. Metagenomics binning is a key step in the species characterisation of microbial communities. Next-generation sequencing reads are usually assembled into contigs for metagenomics binning mainly due to the limited information within short reads. Third-generation sequencing provides much longer reads that have lengths similar to the contigs assembled from short reads. However, existing contig-binning agents cannot be directly applied on long reads due to the absence of coverage information and the presence of high error rates. The few existing long-read binning agents either use only composition or use composition and coverage information separately. This may ignore bins that correspond to low-abundance species or erroneously split bins that correspond to species with non-uniform coverages. Here we present a reference-free binning approach, LRBinner, that combines composition and coverage information of complete long-read datasets. LRBinner also uses a distance-histogram-based clustering algorithm to extract clusters with varying sizes. Results: The experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that LRBinner achieves the best binning accuracy in most cases while handling the complete datasets without any sampling. Moreover, we show that binning reads using LRBinner prior to assembly reduces computational resources required for assembly while attaining satisfactory assembly qualities. Conclusion: LRBinner shows that deep-learning techniques can be used for effective feature aggregation to support the metagenomics binning of long reads. Furthermore, accurate binning of long reads supports improvements in metagenomics assembly, especially in complex datasets. Binning also helps to reduce the resources required for assembly.

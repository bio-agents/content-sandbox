                "abstract": "Published by Oxford University Press 2022. This work is written by (a) US Government employee(s) and is in the public domain in the US.CarrotOmics (https://carrotomics.org/) is a comprehensive database for carrot (Daucus carota L.) breeding and research. CarrotOmics was developed using resources available at the MainLab Bioinformatics core (https://www.bioinfo.wsu.edu/) and is implemented using Tripal with Drupal modules. The database delivers access to download or visualize the carrot reference genome with gene predictions, gene annotations and sequence assembly. Other genomic resources include information for 11 224 genetic markers from 73 linkage maps or genotyping-by-sequencing and descriptions of 371 mapped loci. There are records for 1601 Apiales species (or subspecies) and descriptions of 9408 accessions from 11 germplasm collections representing more than 600 of these species. Additionally, 204 Apiales species have phenotypic information, totaling 28 517 observations from 10 041 biological samples. Resources on CarrotOmics are freely available, search functions are provided to find data of interest and video tutorials are available to describe the search functions and genomic agents. CarrotOmics is a timely resource for the Apiaceae research community and for carrot geneticists developing improved cultivars with novel traits addressing challenges including an expanding acreage in tropical climates, an evolving consumer interested in sustainably grown vegetables and a dynamic environment due to climate change. Data from CarrotOmics can be applied in genomic-assisted selection and genetic research to improve basic research and carrot breeding efficiency. DATABASE URL: https://carrotomics.org/.",

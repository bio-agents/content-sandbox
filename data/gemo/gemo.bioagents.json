                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2022.In silico chromosome painting is a technique by which contributions of distinct genetic groups are represented along chromosomes of hybrid individuals. This type of analysis is used to study the mechanisms by which these individuals were formed. Such techniques are well adapted to identify genetic groups contributing to these individuals as well as hybridization events. It can also be used to follow chromosomal recombinations that occurred naturally or were generated by selective breeding. Here, we present GeMo, a novel interactive web-based and user-oriented interface to visualize in a linear-based fashion results of in silico chromosome painting. To facilitate data input generation, a script to execute analytical commands is provided and an interactive data curation mode is supported to ensure consistency of the automated procedure. GeMo contains preloaded datasets from published studies on crop domestication but can be applied to other purposes, such as breeding programs Although only applied so far on plants, GeMo can handle data from animals as well.",

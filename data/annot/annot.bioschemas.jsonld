This here is just tutorial material for the tutorial described here: http://annot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man_tutorial.html .\n\nWelcome to Annotamentum’s Documentation. — Annot 5 documentation.\n\nWelcome to Annotamentum’s Documentation.¶.\n\nDjango admin based sample, reagent and experiment metadata tracking.\n\nSummary: Annot is a web application, developed for biological wetlab experiment layout, sample and reagent logging, so that data is ready for sharing and analysis. On its core annot makes use of the acpipe_anjson library and acjson - assay coordinate json - file format. The use of controlled vocabulary from ontologies for sample and reagent annotation is enforced. Annot’s modular implementation can be adapted to a variety of experimental paradigms",

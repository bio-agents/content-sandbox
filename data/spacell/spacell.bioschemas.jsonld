      "sc:description": "integrating tissue morphology and spatial gene expression to predict disease cells.\n\nSpaCell has been developed for analysing spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, which include imaging data of tissue sections and RNA expression data across the tissue sections. The ST data add a novel spatial dimension to the traditional gene expression data from dissociated cells. SpaCell is desinged to integrates the two histopathological imaging and sequencing fields, with the ultimate aim to discover novel biology and to improve histopathological diagnosis in a quantitative and automated way",

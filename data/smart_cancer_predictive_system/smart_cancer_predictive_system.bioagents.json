                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious threat to public health due to its poor prognosis. The current study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival of HCC patients. Methods: The model cohort consisted of 24,991 mRNA expression data points from 348 HCC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic mRNA biomarkers for the overall survival of HCC patients. Results: Using multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses, a prognostic nomogram (named Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram) was constructed based on the expression data of N4BP3, -ADRA2B, E2F8, MAPT, PZP, HOXD9, COL15A1, and -NDST3. The C-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.765 (95% CI 0.724-0.806) for the overall survival in the model cohort. The Harrell's concordance-index of the Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram was 0.715 (95% CI 0.658-0.772) in the validation cohort. The survival curves demonstrated that the HCC patients in the high risk group had a significantly poorer overall survival than the patients in the low risk group. Conclusion: In the current study, we have developed two convenient and efficient predictive precision medicine agents for hepatocellular carcinoma. These two predictive precision medicine agents are helpful for predicting the individual mortality risk probability and improving the personalized comprehensive treatments for HCC patients.

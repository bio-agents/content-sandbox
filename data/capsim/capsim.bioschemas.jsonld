Given a genome sequence and a set of probes, it simulates the fragmentation, the dynamics of probe hybridization and the sequencing of the captured fragments on Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms. The simulated data can be used for evaluating the performance of the analysis pipeline, as well as the efficiency of the probe design.",

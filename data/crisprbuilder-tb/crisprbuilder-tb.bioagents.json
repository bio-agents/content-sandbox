    "description": "CRISPRbuilder-TB is a agent that reconstructs the whole CRISPR locus from a Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genome, by using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data. This allows to deduce the real spoligotype, to detect mutants of spacers and direct repeats, insertion of mobile elements, and duplications. The Cas locus is reconstructed too. This is a semi automatic approach that leads to a set of contigs to assemble manually. Depending on the number, length, and quality of SRAs, the number of contigs can range from 1-2 patterns, in the best case scenario where the good quality of sequences allows a quasi-automatic reconstruction of the CRISPR cut in mobile element positions, to several contigs difficult to process, for too short or polluted reads.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) CRISPR locus diversity has long been studied solely investigating the presence/absence of a known set of spacers. Unveiling the genetic mechanisms of its evolution requires a more exhaustive reconstruction in a large amount of representative strains. In this article, we point out and resolve, with a new pipeline, the problem of CRISPR reconstruction based directly on short read sequences in M. tuberculosis. We first show that the process we set up, that we coin as “CRISPRbuilder-TB” (https://github.com/cguyeux/ CRISPRbuilder-TB), allows an efficient reconstruction of simulated or real CRISPRs, even when including complex evolutionary steps like the insertions of mobile elements. Compared to more generalist agents, the whole process is much more precise and robust, and requires only minimal manual investigation. Second, we show that more than 1/3 of the currently complete genomes available for this complex in the public databases contain largely erroneous CRISPR loci. Third, we highlight how both the classical experimental in vitro approach and the basic in silico spoligotyping provided by existing analytic agents miss a whole diversity of this locus in MTC, by not capturing duplications, spacer and direct repeats variants, and IS6110 insertion locations. This description is extended in a second article that describes MTC-CRISPR diversity and suggests general rules for its evolution. This work opens perspectives for an in-depth exploration of M. tuberculosis CRISPR loci diversity and of mechanisms involved in its evolution and its functionality, as well as its adaptation to other CRISPR locus-harboring bacterial species.",

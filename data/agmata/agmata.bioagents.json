Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Protein beta-aggregation is an important but poorly understood phenomena involved in diseases as well as in beneficial physiological processes. However, while this task has been investigated for over 50 years, very little is known about its mechanisms of action. Moreover, the identification of regions involved in aggregation is still an open problem and the state-of-the-art methods are often inadequate in real case applications. Results: In this article we present AgMata, an unsupervised agent for the identification of such regions from amino acidic sequence based on a generalized definition of statistical potentials that includes biophysical information. The agent outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two different benchmarks. As case-study, we applied our agent to human ataxin-3, a protein involved in Machado-Joseph disease. Interestingly, AgMata identifies aggregation-prone residues that share the very same structural environment. Additionally, it successfully predicts the outcome of in vitro mutagenesis experiments, identifying point mutations that lead to an alteration of the aggregation propensity of the wild-type ataxin-3.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2014 Agostini et al.Background: The large amount of data produced by high-throughput sequencing poses new computational challenges. In the last decade, several agents have been developed for the identification of transcription and splicing factor binding sites. Results: Here, we introduce the SeAMotE (Sequence Analysis of Motifs Enrichment) algorithm for discovery of regulatory regions in nucleic acid sequences. SeAMotE provides (i) a robust analysis of high-throughput sequence sets, (ii) a motif search based on pattern occurrences and (iii) an easy-to-use web-server interface. We applied our method to recently published data including 351 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 13 crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments and compared our results with those of other well-established motif discovery agents. SeAMotE shows an average accuracy of 80% in finding discriminative motifs and outperforms other methods available in literature. Conclusions: SeAMotE is a fast, accurate and flexible algorithm for the identification of sequence patterns involved in protein-DNA and protein-RNA recognition.

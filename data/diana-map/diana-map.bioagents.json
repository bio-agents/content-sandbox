                "abstract": "Â© 2020 by the authors.microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (~22 nts) that are considered central post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and key components in many pathological conditions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to inexpensive, massive data production, revolutionizing every research aspect in the fields of biology and medicine. Particularly, small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq) enables small non-coding RNA quantification on a high-throughput scale, providing a closer look into the expression profiles of these crucial regulators within the cell. Here, we present DIANA-microRNA-Analysis-Pipeline (DIANA-mAP), a fully automated computational pipeline that allows the user to perform miRNA NGS data analysis from raw sRNA-Seq libraries to quantification and Differential Expression Analysis in an easy, scalable, efficient, and intuitive way. Emphasis has been given to data pre-processing, an early, critical step in the analysis for the robustness of the final results and conclusions. Through modularity, parallelizability and customization, DIANA-mAP produces high quality expression results, reports and graphs for downstream data mining and statistical analysis. In an extended evaluation, the agent outperforms similar agents providing pre-processing without any adapter knowledge. Closing, DIANA-mAP is a freely available agent. It is available dockerized with no dependency installations or standalone, accompanied by an installation manual through Github.",

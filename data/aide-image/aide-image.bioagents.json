    "description": "AIDE (Annotation-effIcient Deep lEarning) is a deep learning framework for automatic medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, including those having limited annotations, lacking target domain annotations, and containing noisy annotations. Automatic segmentation of medical images plays an essential role in both scientific research and medical care. Deep learning approaches have presented encouraging performances, but existing high-performance methods typically rely on very large training datasets with high-quality manual annotations, which are normally difficult or even impossible to obtain in many clinical applications.",

Existing high-performance deep learning methods typically rely on large training datasets with high-quality manual annotations, which are difficult to obtain in many clinical applications. Here, we introduce Annotation-effIcient Deep lEarning (AIDE), an open-source framework to handle imperfect training datasets. Methodological analyses and empirical evaluations are conducted, and we demonstrate that AIDE surpasses conventional fully-supervised models by presenting better performance on open datasets possessing scarce or noisy annotations. We further test AIDE in a real-life case study for breast tumor segmentation. Three datasets containing 11,852 breast images from three medical centers are employed, and AIDE, utilizing 10% training annotations, consistently produces segmentation maps comparable to those generated by fully-supervised counterparts or provided by independent radiologists. The 10-fold enhanced efficiency in utilizing expert labels has the potential to promote a wide range of biomedical applications.",

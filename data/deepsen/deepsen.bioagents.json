Many key cancer oncogenes are driven by super-enhancers, and the mutations associated with common diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are significantly enriched with super-enhancers. Super-enhancers have shown great potential for the identification of key oncogenes and the discovery of disease-associated mutational sites. Results: In this paper, we propose a new computational method called DEEPSEN for predicting super-enhancers based on convolutional neural network. The proposed method integrates 36 kinds of features. Compared with existing approaches, our method performs better and can be used for genome-wide prediction of super-enhancers. Besides, we screen important features for predicting super-enhancers. Conclusion: Convolutional neural network is effective in boosting the performance of super-enhancer prediction.",

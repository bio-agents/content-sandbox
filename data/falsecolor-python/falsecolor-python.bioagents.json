In order to facilitate clinical adoption of these fluorescence-based techniques, software methods have been developed to convert grayscale fluorescence images into color images that mimic the appearance of standard absorptive chromogens such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). However, these false-coloring algorithms often require manual and iterative adjustment of parameters, with results that can be inconsistent in the presence of intensity nonuniformities within an image and/or between specimens (intra- and inter-specimen variability). Here, we present an open-source (Python-based) rapid intensity-leveling and digital-staining package that is specifically designed to render two-channel fluorescence images (i.e. a fluorescent analog of H&E) to the traditional H&E color space for 2D and 3D microscopy datasets. However, this method can be easily tailored for other false-coloring needs. Our package offers (1) automated and uniform false coloring in spite of uneven staining within a large thick specimen, (2) consistent color-space representations that are robust to variations in staining and imaging conditions between different specimens, and (3) GPU-accelerated data processing to allow these methods to scale to large datasets. We demonstrate this platform by generating H&E-like images from cleared tissues that are fluorescently imaged in 3D with open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, and quantitatively characterizing the results in comparison to traditional slide-based H&E histology.",

  "sc:description": "MetaCV is a composition and phylogeny based algorithm to classify very short metagenomic reads (75-100 bp) into specific taxonomic and functional groups. MetaCV performs (for both sensitivity and specificity) as good as BlastX-based methods on simulated short reads, but runs 300 times faster thus provides effectively and efficiently analysis on huge amount of NGS data.",

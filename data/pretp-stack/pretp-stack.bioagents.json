                "abstract": "IEEETherapeutic peptide prediction is critical for drug development and therapeutic therapy. Researchers have developed several computational methods to identify different therapeutic peptide types. However, most computational methods focus on identifying the specific type of therapeutic peptides and fail to accurately predict all types of therapeutic peptides. Moreover, it is still challenging to utilize different properties features to predict the therapeutic peptides. In this study, a novel stacking framework PreTP-Stack is proposed for predicting different types of therapeutic peptides. PreTP-Stack is constructed based on ten different features and four predictors (Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine). Then the proposed method constructs an auto-weighted multi-view learning model as a final meta-classifier to enhance the performance of the basic models. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved better or highly comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods for predicting eight types of therapeutic peptides A user-friendly web-server predictor is available at http:&#x002F;&#x002F;bliulab.net&#x002F;PreTP-Stack.",

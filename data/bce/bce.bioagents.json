                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.Modern high-throughput structure-based drug discovery algorithms consider ligand flexibility, but typically with low accuracy, which results in a loss of performance in the derived models. Here we present the bioactive conformational ensemble (BCE) server and its associated database. The server creates conformational ensembles of drug-like ligands and stores them in the BCE database, where a variety of analyses are offered to the user. The workflow implemented in the BCE server combines enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with self-consistent reaction field quantum mechanics (SCRF/QM) calculations. The server automatizes all of the steps to transform one-dimensional (1D) or 2D representation of drugs into 3D molecules, which are then titrated, parametrized, hydrated, and optimized before being subjected to Hamiltonian replica-exchange (HREX) molecular dynamics simulations. Ensembles are collected and subjected to a clustering procedure to derive representative conformers, which are then analyzed at the SCRF/QM level of theory. All structural data are organized in a noSQL database accessible through a graphical interface and in a programmatic manner through a REST API. The server allows the user to define a private workspace and offers a deposition protocol as well as input files for \"in house\"calculations in those cases where confidentiality is a must. The database and the associated server are available at https://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/BCE",

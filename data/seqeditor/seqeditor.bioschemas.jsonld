      "sc:description": "an application for primer design and sequence analysis with or without GTF/GFF files.\n\nSeqEditor is a Sequence Browser for the management and analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences of up to 300 megabases. This enables it to manage the largest chromosomes currently known. SeqEditor is an updated version of TIME, a former sequence editor (Mu√±oz et a.l 2011) also implemented as a sequence editor in the former release of GPRO (Futami et al. 2011). The new version provides improved updates of the functions (translation of nucleotide sequences into proteins, editing of sequences, changes in the geometry and orientation of the sequences etc.) and also provides new utilities for the searching and filtering of sequences, ORFs and motifs, managing multiple files simultaneously, primer design, metrics inference, and more.",

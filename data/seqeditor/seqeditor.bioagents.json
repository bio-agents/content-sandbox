    "description": "an application for primer design and sequence analysis with or without GTF/GFF files.\n\nSeqEditor is a Sequence Browser for the management and analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences of up to 300 megabases. This enables it to manage the largest chromosomes currently known. SeqEditor is an updated version of TIME, a former sequence editor (Muñoz et a.l 2011) also implemented as a sequence editor in the former release of GPRO (Futami et al. 2011). The new version provides improved updates of the functions (translation of nucleotide sequences into proteins, editing of sequences, changes in the geometry and orientation of the sequences etc.) and also provides new utilities for the searching and filtering of sequences, ORFs and motifs, managing multiple files simultaneously, primer design, metrics inference, and more.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.MOTIVATION: Sequence analyses oriented to investigate specific features, patterns and functions of protein and DNA/RNA sequences usually require agents based on graphic interfaces whose main characteristic is their intuitiveness and interactivity with the user's expertise, especially when curation or primer design tasks are required. However, interface-based agents usually pose certain computational limitations when managing large sequences or complex datasets, such as genome and transcriptome assemblies. Having these requirments in mind we have developed SeqEditor an interactive software agent for nucleotide and protein sequences' analysis. RESULT: SeqEditor is a cross-platform desktop application for the analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences. It is managed through a Graphical User Interface and can work either as a graphical sequence browser or as a fasta task manager for multi-fasta files. SeqEditor has been optimized for the management of large sequences, such as contigs, scaffolds or even chromosomes, and includes a GTF/GFF viewer to visualize and manage annotation files. In turn, this allows for content mining from reference genomes and transcriptomes with similar efficiency to that of command line agents. SeqEditor also incorporates a set of agents for singleplex and multiplex PCR primer design and pooling that uses a newly optimized and validated search strategy for target and species-specific primers. All these features make SeqEditor a flexible application that can be used to analyses complex sequences, design primers in PCR assays oriented for diagnosis, and/or manage, edit and personalize reference sequence datasets. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: SeqEditor was developed in Java using Eclipse Rich Client Platform and is publicly available at https://gpro.biotechvana.com/download/SeqEditor as binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. The user manual and tutorials are available online at https://gpro.biotechvana.com/agent/seqeditor/manual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

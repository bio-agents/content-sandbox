Somatic mutation data was taken from the COSMIC repository. To delineate the relationship of change in copy number of enhancer elements with the prognosis of cancer patients, survival analysis was done using the survival package in R. We identified 1762 overall survival associated enhancers, which can be used for prognostic purposes of cancer patients in a tissue-specific manner. CancerEnD (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerend/) is developed on a user-friendly responsive template, that enables searching, browsing and downloading of the annotated enhancer elements in terms of gene expression, copy number variation and survival association. We hope it provides a promising avenue for researchers to facilitate the understanding of enhancer deregulation in tumorigenesis, and to identify new biomarkers for therapy and disease-diagnosis.",

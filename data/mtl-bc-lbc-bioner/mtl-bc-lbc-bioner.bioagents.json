Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting deep neural networks for biomedical named entity recognition (Bio-NER). The performance of deep neural networks on a single dataset mostly depends on data quality and quantity while high-quality data tends to be limited in size. To alleviate task-specific data limitation, some studies explored the multi-task learning (MTL) for Bio-NER and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, these MTL methods did not make full use of information from various datasets of Bio-NER. The performance of state-of-the-art MTL method was significantly limited by the number of training datasets. Results: We propose two dataset-aware MTL approaches for Bio-NER which jointly train all models for numerous Bio-NER datasets, thus each of these models could discriminatively exploit information from all of related training datasets. Both of our two approaches achieve substantially better performance compared with the state-of-the-art MTL method on 14 out of 15 Bio-NER datasets. Furthermore, we implemented our approaches by incorporating Bio-NER and biomedical part-of-speech (POS) tagging datasets. The results verify Bio-NER and POS can significantly enhance one another.

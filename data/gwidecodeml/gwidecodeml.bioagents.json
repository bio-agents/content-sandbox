                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2020 Macias et al.One of the most widely used programs for detecting positive selection, at the molecular level, is the program codeml, which is implemented in the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package. However, it has a limitation when it comes to genome-wide studies, as it runs on a gene-by-gene basis. Furthermore, the size of such studies will depend on the number of orthologous genes the genomes have income and these are often restricted to only account for instances where a one-to-one relationship is observed between the genomes. In this work, we present GWideCodeML, a Python package, which runs a genome-wide codeml with the option of parallelization. To maximize the number of analyzed genes, the package allows for a variable number of taxa in the alignments and will automatically prune the topology to fit each of them, before running codeml.",

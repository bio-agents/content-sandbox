                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2020 Masinas et al.Advances in genome engineering and high throughput imaging technologies have enabled genome-scale screens of single cells for a variety of phenotypes, including subcellular morphology and protein localization. We constructed TheCellVision.org, a freely available and web-accessible image visualization and data browsing agent that serves as a central repository for fluorescence microscopy images and associated quantitative data produced by high-content screening experiments. Currently, TheCellVision.org hosts ~575,590 images and associated analysis results from two published high-content screening (HCS) projects focused on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TheCellVision.org allows users to access, visualize and explore fluorescence microscopy images, and to search, compare, and extract data related to subcellular compartment morphology, protein abundance, and localization. Each dataset can be queried independently or as part of a search across multiple datasets using the advanced search option. The website also hosts computational agents associated with the available datasets, which can be applied to other projects and cell systems, a feature we demonstrate using published images of mammalian cells. Providing access to HCS data through websites such as TheCellVision.org enables new discovery and independent re-analyses of imaging data.",

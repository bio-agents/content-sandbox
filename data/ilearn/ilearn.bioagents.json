All rights reserved.With the explosive growth of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic era, one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology is to computationally characterize sequences, structures and functions in an efficient, accurate and high-throughput manner. A number of online web servers and stand-alone agents have been developed to address this to date; however, all these agents have their limitations and drawbacks in terms of their effectiveness, user-friendliness and capacity. Here, we present iLearn, a comprehensive and versatile Python-based agentkit, integrating the functionality of feature extraction, clustering, normalization, selection, dimensionality reduction, predictor construction, best descriptor/model selection, ensemble learning and results visualization for DNA, RNA and protein sequences. iLearn was designed for users that only want to upload their data set and select the functions they need calculated from it, while all necessary procedures and optimal settings are completed automatically by the software. iLearn includes a variety of descriptors for DNA, RNA and proteins, and four feature output formats are supported so as to facilitate direct output usage or communication with other computational agents. In total, iLearn encompasses 16 different types of feature clustering, selection, normalization and dimensionality reduction algorithms, and five commonly used machine-learning algorithms, thereby greatly facilitating feature analysis and predictor construction. iLearn is made freely available via an online web server and a stand-alone agentkit.",

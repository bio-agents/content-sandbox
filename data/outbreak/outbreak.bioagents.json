                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).The current COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed more than 3.7 million victims and it will cause more deaths in the coming months. Agents that track the number and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and help in making policy decisions for controlling the outbreak. However, the current surveillance web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive and require specific computational knowledge. We developed a user-friendly web agent, named OUTBREAK, that facilitates epidemic surveillance by showing in an animated graph the timeline and geolocations of cases of an outbreak. It permits even non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in real-time. We applied our agent to visualize the SARS 2003, MERS, and COVID19 epidemics, and provided them as examples on the website. Through the zoom feature, it is also possible to visualize cases at city and even neighborhood levels. We made the agent freely available at https://outbreak.sysbio.agents/. OUTBREAK has the potential to guide and help health authorities to intervene and minimize the effects of outbreaks.",

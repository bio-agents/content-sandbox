Hundreds of causal genes and biological pathways have been reported to be closely correlated with ophthalmic diseases. However, these information are scattered across various resources, which has hindered a thorough and deep understanding of ophthalmic diseases. In the present work, we proposed the Human Ophthalmic Diseases Database (HODD), which currently deposits 730 ophthalmic diseases and 653 related genes and is available at http://bio-bigdata.cn/HODD/. The disease-related information and genes related to ophthalmic diseases were collected from the several well-known databases. To comprehensively understand the ophthalmic diseases, the basic information was provided for each disease, including disease description, related genes, gene location, ocular and extraocular effect of the disease, protein–protein interaction and disease-associated pathways. All these data were reorganized and made accessible through multiple entrances. We hope that HODD will facilitate studies on ophthalmic diseases.

                "abstract": "Â© 2020, The Author(s).N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) is a post-transcriptional modification in mRNA which plays a major role in the stability and regulation of mRNA translation. The working mechanism of ac4C modification in mRNA is still unclear and traditional laboratory experiments are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we propose an XG-ac4C machine learning model based on the eXtreme Gradient Boost classifier for the identification of ac4C sites. The XG-ac4C model uses a combination of electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials and electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials of trinucleotide of the nucleotides in ac4C sites. Moreover, Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations are applied to understand the importance of features and their contribution to the final prediction outcome. The obtained results demonstrate that XG-ac4C outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In more detail, the proposed model improves the area under the precision-recall curve by 9.4% and 9.6% in cross-validation and independent tests, respectively. Finally, a user-friendly web server based on the proposed model for ac4C site identification is made freely available at http://nsclbio.jbnu.ac.kr/agents/xgac4c/.",

                "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been applied for studying interactions between polarized light and biological tissues, but most existing MC codes supporting polarization modeling can only simulate homogeneous or multi-layered domains, resulting in approximations when handling realistic tissue structures. AIM: Over the past decade, the speed of MC simulations has seen dramatic improvement with massively parallel computing techniques. Developing hardware-accelerated MC simulation algorithms that can accurately model polarized light inside three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous tissues can greatly expand the utility of polarization in biophotonics applications. APPROACH: Here, we report a highly efficient polarized MC algorithm capable of modeling arbitrarily complex media defined over a voxelated domain. Each voxel of the domain can be associated with spherical scatters of various radii and densities. The Stokes vector of each simulated photon packet is updated through photon propagation, creating spatially resolved polarization measurements over the detectors or domain surface. RESULTS: We have implemented this algorithm in our widely disseminated MC simulator, Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX). It is validated by comparing with a reference central-processing-unit-based simulator in both homogeneous and layered domains, showing excellent agreement and a 931-fold speedup. CONCLUSION: The polarization-enabled MCX offers biophotonics community an efficient agent to explore polarized light in bio-tissues, and is freely available at http://mcx.space/.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2015 Bloom; licensee BioMed Central.Background: Deep mutational scanning is a technique to estimate the impacts of mutations on a gene by using deep sequencing to count mutations in a library of variants before and after imposing a functional selection. The impacts of mutations must be inferred from changes in their counts after selection. Results: I describe a software package, dms_agents, to infer the impacts of mutations from deep mutational scanning data using a likelihood-based treatment of the mutation counts. I show that dms_agents yields more accurate inferences on simulated data than simply calculating ratios of counts pre- and post-selection. Using dms_agents, one can infer the preference of each site for each amino acid given a single selection pressure, or assess the extent to which these preferences change under different selection pressures. The preferences and their changes can be intuitively visualized with sequence-logo-style plots created using an extension to weblogo. Conclusions: dms_agents implements a statistically principled approach for the analysis and subsequent visualization of deep mutational scanning data.",

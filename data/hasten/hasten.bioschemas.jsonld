      "sc:description": "HASTEN is a agent that makes it easier to run machine learning boosted virtual screening workflows. It is written in very general Python without relying in non-standard libraries so it is easy to run in any Python environment\n\nCurrently only chemprop is supported as machine learning method, but it is easy to write Shell-scripts to plug-in your own methods. Glide from Schrodinger is supported in this version, but the same applies here: it should be easy to plug-in your own docking program. Do note that the HASTEN assumes that the smaller the docking score, the better the score.\n\nThere is also simulation mode, which allows you to run benchmarks using existing docking_scores without in reality doing anything in 3D. This mode can be useful when adjusting the machine learning parameters.",

description: This is a hi-c analysis package using a cumulative binomial test to detect
  interactions between distal genomic loci that have significantly more reads than
  expected by chance in hi-c experiments. it takes mapped paired ngs reads as input
  and gives back the list of significant interactions for a given bin size in the
  genome.

description: LibSBML is an application programming interface library for reading,
  writing, manipulating and validating content expressed in the Systems Biology Markup
  Language (SBML) format. It is written in ISO C and C++, provides language bindings
  for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Octave, and includes many features
  that facilitate adoption and use of both SBML and the library. Developers can embed
  libSBML in their applications, saving themselves the work of implementing their
  own SBML parsing, manipulation and validation software.

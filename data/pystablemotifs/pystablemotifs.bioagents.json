Its non-heuristic and exhaustive attractor identification algorithm was previously presented in Rozum et al. (2021). Here, we illustrate its performance improvements over similar methods and discuss how it uses outputs of the attractor identification process to drive a system to one of its attractors from any initial state. We implement six attractor control algorithms, five of which are new in this work. By design, these algorithms can return different control strategies, allowing for synergistic use. We also give a brief overview of the other agents implemented in pystablemotifs.",

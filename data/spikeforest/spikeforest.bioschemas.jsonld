      "sc:description": "reproducible web-facing ground-truth validation of automated neural spike sorters.\n\nSpike sorting is a crucial but time-intensive step in electrophysiological studies of neuronal activity. While there are many popular software packages for spike sorting, there is little consensus about which are the most accurate under different experimental conditions. SpikeForest is an open-source and reproducible software suite that benchmarks the performance of automated spike sorting algorithms across an extensive, curated database of electrophysiological recordings with ground truth, displaying results interactively on a continuously-updating website. With contributions from over a dozen participating laboratories, our database currently comprises 650 recordings (1.3 TB total size) with around 35,000 ground-truth units",

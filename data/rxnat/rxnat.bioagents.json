    "description": "Rxnat: Query and retrieves neuroimaging sets from XNAT projects.\n\nXNAT is an extensible open-source imaging informatics software platform dedicated to imaging-based research.\n\n\nTo use system environment variables we need to add them to the .Renviron file located in the user's home folder. Use Sys.getenv(\"HOME\") to get the path (for unix/osx users the location can be easily accessed with ~, eg. vi ~/.Renviron). The Rxnat package will be able to automatically read / use a system environment variable provided the following format is used: XXXX_RXNAT_USER and XXXX_RXNAT_PASS. XXXX is provided as an argument when an XNAT connection is initiated.",

                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2020 Gherman, Muschelli, Caffo and Crainiceanu.The extensible neuroimaging archive agentkit (XNAT) is a common platform for storing and distributing neuroimaging data and is used by many key repositories of public neuroimaging data. Some examples include the Neuroimaging Informatics Agents and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC, https://nitrc.org/), the ConnectomeDB for the Human Connectome Project (https://db.humanconnectome.org/), and XNAT Central (https://central.xnat.org/). We introduce Rxnat (https://github.com/adigherman/Rxnat), an open-source R package designed to interact with any XNAT-based repository. The program has similar capabilities with PyXNAT and XNATpy, which were developed for Python users. Rxnat was developed to address the increased popularity of R among neuroimaging researchers. The Rxnat package can query multiple XNAT repositories and download all or a specific subset of images for further processing. This provides a lingua franca for the large community of R analysts to interface with multiple XNAT-based publicly available neuroimaging repositories. The potential of Rxnat is illustrated using an example of neuroimaging data normalization from two neuroimaging repositories, NITRC and HCP.",

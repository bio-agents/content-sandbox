  "sc:description": "Mass cytometry uses heavy metal isotopes rather than fluorescent tags as reporters to label antibodies, thereby substantially decreasing spectral overlap and allowing for examination of over 50 parameters at the single cell level. Cytometry dATa anALYSis Agents is designed to provide a pipeline for preprocessing of cytometry data, including i) normalization using bead standards, ii) single-cell deconvolution, and iii) bead-based compensation.",

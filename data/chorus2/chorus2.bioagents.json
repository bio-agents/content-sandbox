Plant Biotechnology Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and The Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Oligonucleotide (oligo)-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has rapidly becoming the new generation of FISH technique in plant molecular cytogenetics research. Genome-scale identification of single-copy oligos is the foundation of successful oligo-FISH experiments. Here, we introduce Chorus2, a software that is developed specifically for oligo selection. We demonstrate that Chorus2 is highly effective to remove all repetitive elements in selection of single-copy oligos, which is critical for the development of successful FISH probes. Chorus2 is more effective than Chorus, the original version of the pipeline, and OligoMiner for repeat removal. Chorus2 allows to select oligos that are conserved among related species, which extends the usage of oligo-FISH probes among phylogenetically related plant species. We also implemented a new function in Chorus2 that allows development of FISH probes from plant species without an assembled genome. We anticipate that Chorus2 can be used in plants as well as in mammalian and other non-plant species. Chorus2 will broadly facilitate the design of FISH probes for various types of application in molecular cytogenetics research.",

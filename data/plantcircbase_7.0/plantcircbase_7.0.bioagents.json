                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s)Circular RNA (circRNA) is a special type of non-coding RNA that participates in diverse biological processes in both animals and plants. Five years ago, we developed a comprehensive plant circRNA database (PlantcircBase), which has attracted much attention from the plant circRNA community. Here, we report an updated PlantcircBase (v.7.0), which contains 171,118 circRNAs from 21 plant species. Over 31,000 of the circRNAs have full-length sequences constructed based on analysis of 749 bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets downloaded from the public domain and Nanopore long-read sequencing results of rice RNAs newly generated in this study. A plant multiple conservation score (PMCS), based on the conservation of both sequence and expression profiles, was calculated for each circRNA to quantify and compare the conservation of all circRNAs. A new parameter, plant circRNA confidence level (PCCL), is introduced to measure the identity reliability of each circRNA based on experimental validation results and the number of references that support the circRNA. All this information and other details of circRNAs can be browsed, searched, and downloaded from PlantcircBase 7.0, which also provides online bioinformatics agents for visualization and sequence alignment. PlantcircBase 7.0 is publicly and freely accessible at http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/plantcircbase/.",

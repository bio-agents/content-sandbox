                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Chen, Yu and Yang.The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are easily contaminated by various artifacts and noise, which induces a domain shift in each subject and significant pattern variability among different subjects. Therefore, it hinders the improvement of EEG classification accuracy in the cross-subject learning scenario. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively applied to EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) by virtue of the capability of performing automatic feature extraction and classification. However, they have been mainly applied to the within-subject classification which would consume lots of time for training and calibration. Thus, it limits the further applications of CNNs in BCIs. In order to build a robust classification algorithm for a calibration-less BCI system, we propose an end-to-end model that transforms the EEG signals into symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and captures the features of SPD matrices by using a CNN. To avoid the time-consuming calibration and ensure the application of the proposed model, we use the meta-transfer-learning (MTL) method to learn the essential features from different subjects. We validate our model by making extensive experiments on three public motor-imagery datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in the cross-subject learning scenario.",

      "sc:description": "A parallel pipeline and interactive analysis agent for multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing to assess DNA methylation biomarker panels for disease detection.\n\nMethPanel is a computational pipeline in Linux operating system with an interactive graphical interface for rapid analysis of multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing data. The agent covers a complete analysis workflow from genomic alignment to DNA methylation calling and supports an unlimited number of PCR amplicons and input samples. Moreover MethPanel offers important and unique features, such as a epipolymorphism score and a bisulphite PCR bias correction. MethPanel can be run in parallel by samples on either a personal computer or a high performance computer. The outputs are automatically forwarded to a shinyApp for convenient display, visualisation and sharing of data with collaborators and clinicians.",

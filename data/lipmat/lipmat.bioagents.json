                "abstract": "© 2019 American Chemical Society.Global lipid analysis still lags behind proteomics with respect to the availability of databases, experimental protocols, and specialized software. Determining the lipidome of cellular model systems in common use is of particular importance, especially when research questions involve lipids directly. In Parkinson's disease research, there is a growing awareness for the role of the biological membrane, where individual lipids may contribute to provoking α-synuclein oligomerisation and fibrillation. We present an analysis of the whole cell and plasma membrane lipid isolates of a neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, a commonly used model system for research on this and other neurodegenerative diseases. We have used two complementary lipidomics methods. The relative quantities of PC, PE, SMs, CL, PI, PG, and PS were determined by 31P NMR. Fatty acid chain composition and their relative abundances within each phospholipid group were evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For this part of the analysis, we have developed and made available a set of Matlab scripts, LipMat. Our approach allowed us to observe several deviations of lipid abundances when compared to published reports regarding phospholipid analysis of cell cultures or brain matter. The most striking was the high abundance of PC (54.7 ± 1.9%) and low abundance of PE (17.8 ± 4.8%) and SMs (2.7 ± 1.2%). In addition, the observed abundance of PS was smaller than expected (4.7 ± 2.7%), similar to the observed abundance of PG (4.5 ± 1.8%). The observed fatty acid chain distribution was similar to the whole brain content with some notable differences: a higher abundance of 16:1 PC FA (17.4 ± 3.4% in PC whole cell content), lower abundance of 22:6 PE FA (15.9 ± 2.2% in plasma membrane fraction), and a complete lack of 22:6 PS FA.",

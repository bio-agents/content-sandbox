The protein sequences having each architecture can be displayed on the plot and separately listed. Where there is 3D structural information in the PDB, the relevant PDB codes can be shown on the plot. Sequences can be be filtered by organism, or the output can be limited to just those protein sequences for which there is structural information in the PDB.",

Nevertheless, online databases for searching the current zebrafish xenograft literature are in great demand. Herein, we have developed a manually curated database, called ZenoFishDb v1.1 (https://konulab.shinyapps.io/ zenofishdb), based on R Shiny platform aiming to provide searchable information on ever increasing collection of zebrafish studies for cancer cell line transplantation and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). ZenoFishDb v1.1 user interface contains four modules: DataTable, Visualization, PDX Details, and PDX Charts. The DataTable and Visualization pages represent xenograft study details, including injected cell lines, PDX injections, molecular modifications of cell lines, zebrafish strains, as well as technical aspects of the xenotransplantation procedures in table, bar, and/or pie chart formats. The PDX Details module provides comprehensive information on the patient details in table format and can be searched and visualized. Overall, ZenoFishDb v1.1 enables researchers to effectively search, list, and visualize different technical and biological attributes of zebrafish xenotransplantation studies particularly focusing on the new trends that make use of reporters, RNA interference, overexpression, or mutant gene constructs of transplanted cancer cells, stem cells, and PDXs, as well as distinguished host modifications.",

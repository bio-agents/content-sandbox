                "abstract": "Â© 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.We introduce the systematic database of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images obtained using density functional theory (DFT) for two-dimensional (2D) materials, calculated using the Tersoff-Hamann method. It currently contains data for 716 exfoliable 2D materials. Examples of the five possible Bravais lattice types for 2D materials and their Fourier-transforms are discussed. All the computational STM images generated in this work are made available on the JARVIS-STM website (https://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvisstm). We find excellent qualitative agreement between the computational and experimental STM images for selected materials. As a first example application of this database, we train a convolution neural network model to identify the Bravais lattice from the STM images. We believe the model can aid high-throughput experimental data analysis. These computational STM images can directly aid the identification of phases, analyzing defects and lattice-distortions in experimental STM images, as well as be incorporated in the autonomous experiment workflows.",

description: This package implements a set of agents for transcriptome instability
  analysis based on exon expression profiles. deviating exon usage is studied in the
  context of splicing factors to analyse to what degree transcriptome instability
  is correlated to splicing factor expression. in the transcriptome instability correlation
  analysis, the data is compared to both random permutations of alternative splicing
  scores and expression of random gene sets.

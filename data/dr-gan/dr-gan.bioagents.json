                "abstract": "IEEEThis article presents a new text-to-image (T2I) generation model, named distribution regularization generative adversarial network (DR-GAN), to generate images from text descriptions from improved distribution learning. In DR-GAN, we introduce two novel modules: a semantic disentangling module (SDM) and a distribution normalization module (DNM). SDM combines the spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a new semantic disentangling loss (SDL) to help the generator distill key semantic information for the image generation. DNM uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to normalize and denoise the image latent distribution, which can help the discriminator better distinguish synthesized images from real images. DNM also adopts a distribution adversarial loss (DAL) to guide the generator to align with normalized real image distributions in the latent space. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated that our DR-GAN achieved a competitive performance in the T2I task.

                "abstract": "The MPI Bioinformatics Agentkit is an interactive web service which offers access to a great variety of public and in-house bioinformatics agents. They are grouped into different sections that support sequence searches, multiple alignment, secondary and tertiary structure prediction and classification. Several public agents are offered in customized versions that extend their functionality. For example, PSI-BLAST can be run against regularly updated standard databases, customized user databases or selectable sets of genomes. Another agent, Quick2D, integrates the results of various secondary structure, transmembrane and disorder prediction programs into one view. The Agentkit provides a friendly and intuitive user interface with an online help facility. As a key feature, various agents are interconnected so that the results of one agent can be forwarded to other agents. One could run PSI-BLAST, parse out a multiple alignment of selected hits and send the results to a cluster analysis agent. The Agentkit framework and the agents developed in-house will be packaged and freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL). The Agentkit can be accessed at http://agentkit.tuebingen.mpg.de. Â© The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rigths reserved.",

                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2020 Zhou, Hu, Shen, Zhang and Du.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in serval biological activities, including transcription, splicing, translation, and some other cellular regulation processes. lncRNAs perform their biological functions by interacting with various proteins. The studies on lncRNA-protein interactions are of great value to the understanding of lncRNA functional mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed a novel model to predict potential lncRNA-protein interactions using the SKF (similarity kernel fusion) and LapRLS (Laplacian regularized least squares) algorithms. We named this method the LPI-SKF. Various similarities of both lncRNAs and proteins were integrated into the LPI-SKF. LPI-SKF can be applied in predicting potential interactions involving novel proteins or lncRNAs. We obtained an AUROC (area under receiver operating curve) of 0.909 in a 5-fold cross-validation, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. A total of 19 out of the top 20 ranked interaction predictions were verified by existing data, which implied that the LPI-SKF had great potential in discovering unknown lncRNA-protein interactions accurately. All data and codes of this work can be downloaded from a GitHub repository (https://github.com/zyk2118216069/LPI-SKF).",

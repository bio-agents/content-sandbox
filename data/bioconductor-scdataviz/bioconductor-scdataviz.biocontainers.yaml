description: In the single cell World, which includes flow cytometry, mass cytometry,
  single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and others, there is a need to improve data visualisation
  and to bring analysis capabilities to researchers even from non-technical backgrounds.
  scDataviz attempts to fit into this space, while also catering for advanced users.
  Additonally, due to the way that scDataviz is designed, which is based on SingleCellExperiment,
  it has a plug and play feel, and immediately lends itself as flexibile and compatibile
  with studies that go beyond scDataviz. Finally, the graphics in scDataviz are generated
  via the ggplot engine, which means that users can add on features to these with
  ease.

description: A general framework for finite mixtures of regression models using the
  EM algorithm is implemented. The package provides the E-step and all data handling,
  while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new models. Existing
  drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear models
  and model-based clustering.

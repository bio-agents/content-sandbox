description: In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) identification
  from sequence/alignments, we are interested in the significance of certain match
  score. TFMPvalue provides the accurate calculation of P-value with score threshold
  for Position Weight Matrices, or the score with given P-value. It is an interface
  to code originally made available by Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007,
  Algorithms Mol Biol:2, 15. Touzet and Varre (2007) <DOI:10.1186/1748-7188-2-15>.

summary: BCFagents is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant
  Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work transparently
  with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.  Most commands accept
  VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected automatically even when streaming
  from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work in all situations. Un-indexed VCF and
  BCF and streams will work in most, but not all situations.
version: 1.11

description: Maxentscan is based on the approach for modeling the sequences of short
  sequence motifs such as those involved in rna splicing which simultaneously accounts
  for non-adjacent as well as adjacent dependencies between positions. This method
  is based on the 'maximum entropy principle' and generalizes most previous probabilistic
  models of sequence motifs such as weight matrix models and inhomogeneous markov
  models.

                "abstract": "© 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The Curated Protein Aggregation Database (CPAD) is a manually curated and open-access database dedicated to providing comprehensive information related to mechanistic, kinetic and structural aspects of protein and peptide aggregation. The database has been updated to CPAD 2.0 by significantly expanding datasets and improving the user-interface. Key features of CPAD 2.0 are (i) 83,098 data points on aggregation kinetics experiments, (ii) 565 structures related to aggregation, which are classified into proteins, fibrils, and protein-ligand complexes, (iii) 2031 aggregating/non-aggregating peptides with pre-calculated aggregation properties, and (iv) 912 aggregation-prone regions in amyloidogenic proteins. This database will help the scientific community (a) by facilitating research leading to improved understanding of protein aggregation, (b) by helping develop, validate and benchmark mechanistic and kinetic models of protein aggregation, and (c) by assisting experimentalists with design of their investigations and dissemination of data generated by their studies. CPAD 2.0 can be accessed at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/cpad2/index.html.",

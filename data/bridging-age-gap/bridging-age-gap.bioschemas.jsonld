A agent designed to allow for the comparison of breast cancer treatments for older women. The treatments considered within this agent are surgery, primary endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. This agent is designed for use by clinicians with appropriate knowledge of breast cancer and the two types of treatment that are addressed here.",

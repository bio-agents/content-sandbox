      "sc:description": "The Nubeam reference-free approach to analyze metagenomic sequencing reads.\n\nNubeam is a reference-free approach to analyze short sequencing reads. It represents nucleotides by matrices, transforms a read into a product of matrices, and based on which assigns numbers to reads. A sequencing sample, which is a collection of reads, becomes a collection of numbers that form an empirical distribution. Then the genetic difference between samples is quantified by the distance between empirical distributions.",

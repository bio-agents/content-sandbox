For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: The crux of molecular property prediction is to generate meaningful representations of the molecules. One promising route is to exploit the molecular graph structure through graph neural networks (GNNs). Both atoms and bonds significantly affect the chemical properties of a molecule, so an expressive model ought to exploit both node (atom) and edge (bond) information simultaneously. Inspired by this observation, we explore the multi-view modeling with GNN (MVGNN) to form a novel paralleled framework, which considers both atoms and bonds equally important when learning molecular representations. In specific, one view is atom-central and the other view is bond-central, then the two views are circulated via specifically designed components to enable more accurate predictions. To further enhance the expressive power of MVGNN, we propose a cross-dependent message-passing scheme to enhance information communication of different views. The overall framework is termed as CD-MVGNN. Results: We theoretically justify the expressiveness of the proposed model in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphism graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CD-MVGNN achieves remarkably superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on various challenging benchmarks. Meanwhile, visualization results of the node importance are consistent with prior knowledge, which confirms the interpretability power of CD-MVGNN.",

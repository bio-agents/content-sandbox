  description: Methods for robust rank aggregation
  long_description: " Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of\n\
    \ genes. It implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al\n in preparation)\
    \ and some other simple algorithms for the task.\n RRA method uses a probabilistic\
    \ model for aggregation that is\n robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation\
    \ of\n significance probabilities for all the elements in the final\n ranking.\n"

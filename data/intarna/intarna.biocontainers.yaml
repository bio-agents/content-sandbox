description: Efficient RNA-RNA interaction prediction incorporating accessibility
  and seeding of interaction sites\n\nDuring the last few years, several new small
  regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been discovered in bacteria. Most of them act as post-transcriptional
  regulators by base pairing to a target mRNA, causing translational repression or
  activation, or mRNA degradation. Numerous sRNAs have already been identified, but
  the number of experimentally verified targets is considerably lower. Consequently,
  computational target prediction is in great demand. Many existing target prediction
  programs neglect the accessibility of target sites and the existence of a seed,
  while other approaches are either specialized to certain types of RNAs or too slow
  for genome-wide searches.\n\nIntaRNA, developed by Prof. Backofen's bioinformatics
  group at Freiburg University, is a general and fast approach to the prediction of
  RNA-RNA interactions incorporating both the accessibility of interacting sites as
  well as the existence of a user-definable seed interaction. We successfully applied
  IntaRNA to the prediction of bacterial sRNA targets and determined the exact locations
  of the interactions with a higher accuracy than competing programs.

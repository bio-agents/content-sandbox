This currently means that, given the input of data files and a list of masses of know, or unknown compounds, the application is going to produce the MS1 and MS2 chromatograms of the substances in the list, as well as the MS2 spectra. None of these features have been post-processed in the slightest. However, there is a built-in prescreening aid that will\nhelp the user assess the quality of the spectra.",

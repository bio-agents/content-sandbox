description: 'Automatic filtering, trimming, error removing and quality control for
  fastq data. afterqc can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and then output
  three folders: good, bad and qc folders, which contains good reads, bad reads and
  the qc results of each fastq file/pair. currently it supports processing data from
  hiseq 2000/2500/3000/4000, nextseq 500/550, miniseq...and other illumina 1.8 or
  newer formats.'

The application suite includes agents with the ability to create consensus sequences, call nucleotide, codon, and amino acid variants, calculate the complexity of a quasispecies, and measure the genetic distance between two similar quasispecies. These agents may be run independently or in user-created workflows. Availability The quasiagents suite is a freely available application licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The source code, documentation, and file specifications are available at: https: phac-nml.github.io quasiagents Contact gary.vandomselaar@canada.ca",

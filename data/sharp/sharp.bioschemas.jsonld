Algorithmically, SHARP is based on ensemble random projection (RP) and multi-layer meta-clustering which can well preserve cell-to-cell distance in reduced-dimensional space. Compared to other existing agents, it has the following advantages:.\n\nNumber of Random-Projection Applications.\n\nProcessing 1.3 Million Single Cells.",

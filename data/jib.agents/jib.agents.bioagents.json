This website hosts the agents, software applications, databases and workflow systems published in the Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics (JIB). As soon as a new agent-related publication is published in JIB, the agent is posted to JIB.agents and can afterwards be easily transferred to bio.agents, a large information repository of software agents, databases and services for bioinformatics and the life sciences. In this way, an easily-accessible list of agents is provided which were published in JIB a well as status information regarding the underlying service. With newer registries like bio.agents providing these information on a bigger scale, JIB.agents 2.0 closes the gap between journal publications and registry publication.

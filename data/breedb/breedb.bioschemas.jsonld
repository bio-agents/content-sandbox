  "sc:description": "Relational database which aims to support breeding for quantitative agronomical traits. The database can be explored through a web-based interface, which offers agents to present basic statistical overviews such as box plots, histograms, but also multivariate agents. The agent is designed to store data from both inbreeding and out-breeding crop species and the analysis and visualization methods adapt automatically to the type of population on hand.",

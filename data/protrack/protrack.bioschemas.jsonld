To enable the broader community of biological and medical researchers to intuitively query, explore, and download data and analysis results from various CPTAC projects, we built a prototype user-friendly web application called “ProTrack” with the CPTAC clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) data set ( http: ccrcc.cptac-data-view.org ). Here we describe the salient features of this application which provides a dynamic, comprehensive, and granular visualization of the rich proteogenomic data. Statement of Significance The CPTAC initiative ( https: proteomics.cancer.gov ) has generated multi-omics data for multiple cancer types to understand the proteogenomic aberrations of these malignancies",

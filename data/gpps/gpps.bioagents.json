Differently from the previous agent. gpps employs a maximum likelihood search to find the best tree that explain the input, starting from single cell data.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020, The Author(s).Background: Cancer progression reconstruction is an important development stemming from the phylogenetics field. In this context, the reconstruction of the phylogeny representing the evolutionary history presents some peculiar aspects that depend on the technology used to obtain the data to analyze: Single Cell DNA Sequencing data have great specificity, but are affected by moderate false negative and missing value rates. Moreover, there has been some recent evidence of back mutations in cancer: this phenomenon is currently widely ignored. Results: We present a new agent, gpps, that reconstructs a tumor phylogeny from Single Cell Sequencing data, allowing each mutation to be lost at most a fixed number of times. The General Parsimony Phylogeny from Single cell (gpps) agent is open source and available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/gpps. Conclusions: gpps provides new insights to the analysis of intra-tumor heterogeneity by proposing a new progression model to the field of cancer phylogeny reconstruction on Single Cell data.",

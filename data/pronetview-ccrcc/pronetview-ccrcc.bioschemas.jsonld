      "sc:description": "A web-based portal to interactively explore clear cell renal cell carcinoma proteogenomics networks.\n\nan interactive WebGL visualizer of 3D Networks.\n\nNCI supported Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome (proteins) and genome (DNA and RNA) analysis technologies to different cancer types. CPTAC is composed of expertise in proteomics, genomics, cancer biology, oncology, and clinical chemistry, while creating open community resources that are widely used by the cancer community.\n\nThis page provides visualization of the networks estimated based on proteogenomic data from CPTAC-CCRCC discovery project. For more information, visit the CPTAC-CCRCC data portal.\n\nCo-expression network was constructed based on phospho-peptide data of 103 Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) samples.",

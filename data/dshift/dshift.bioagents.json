The prediction methods are based on sets of published reference chemical shift values and correction factors which account for shielding or deshielding effects from neighboring nucleotides. Proton, carbon and phosphorus chemical shift predictions are available for random coil DNAs. For double helical B-DNA, only proton chemical shift prediction is available. Results from these predictions will be useful for facilitating NMR resonance assignments and investigating structural features of solution DNA molecules.

Due to the presence of residual base stacking in these sequences, the temperature and sequence effects were investigated at 50 and 55°C. The phosphorus chemical shifts of random coil DNA sequences have been found to be independent of temperature. Sequence effect analysis shows that the phosphorus chemical shift of a nucleotide in a random coil DNA sequence depends on both its 5′- and 3′-nearest neighbors. A trimer model has been used to establish the random coil 31P chemical shift prediction protocol which shows an accuracy of 0.02 ppm. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Based on the proton chemical shifts measured for the central nucleotides in 64 triplets and the correction factors determined for the next nearest neighbor effects, a parameter set has been derived for predicting random coil DNA proton chemical shifts. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the predicted and the observed aromatic H6/H8 proton chemical shifts of ∼200 data from 22 random coil DNA sequences was determined to be 0.02 ppm with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. For the H1′, H2′, H2″ and H3′ sugar protons, the RMSD values between the predicted and the experimental shifts were found to be 0.02, 0.03, 0.03 and 0.02 ppm, respectively.",

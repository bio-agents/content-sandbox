It supports 1 and 2-dimensional systems and provides agents to easily implement extended defects such as grain boundaries or sample surfaces. Sesame is designed to facilitate fast exploration of the system parameter space and to visualize local charge transport properties. Sesame has been benchmarked against other software packages, and results for single crystal and polycrystalline CdS-CdTe heterojunctions are presented. Sesame is distributed as a Python package or as a standalone GUI application, and is available at https://pages.nist.gov/sesame/.",

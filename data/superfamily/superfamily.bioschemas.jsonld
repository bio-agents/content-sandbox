  "sc:description": "It provides protein domain assignments at the structural classification of protein superfamily level for completely sequenced genomes, metagenomes and other gene collections such as UniProt. Our scoring component now uses HMMER3. A cloud-based pipeline was implemented and is publicly available. The SUPERFAMILY reference tree of life has been improved allowing the user to highlight a chosen superfamily, family or domain architecture on the tree of life.",

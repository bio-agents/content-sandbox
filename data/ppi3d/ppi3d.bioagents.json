                "abstract": "© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.There is a large gap between the numbers of known protein–protein interactions and the corresponding experimentally solved structures of protein complexes. Fortunately, this gap can be in part bridged by computational structure modeling methods. Currently, template-based modeling is the most accurate means to predict both individual protein structures and protein complexes. One of the major issues in template-based modeling is to identify homologous structures that could be utilized as templates. To simplify this task, we have developed the PPI3D web server. The server is not only able to search for homologous protein complexes, but also provides means to analyze identified interactions and to model protein complexes. In recent CASP and CAPRI experiments, PPI3D proved to be a useful agent for homology modeling of multimeric proteins. In this chapter, we provide a brief description of the PPI3D web server capabilities and how to use the server for modeling of protein complexes.",

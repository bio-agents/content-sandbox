The new official website for OMIM, OMIM.org (http://omim.org), was launched in January 2011. OMIM is based on the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature and is used by overlapping and diverse communities of clinicians, molecular biologists and genome scientists, as well as by students and teachers of these disciplines. Genes and phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner. OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS, Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and through an API. MIMmatch is a novel outreach feature to disseminate updates and encourage collaboration.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.For over 50 years Mendelian Inheritance in Man has chronicled the collective knowledge of the field of medical genetics. It initially cataloged the known X-linked, autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inherited disorders, but grew to be the primary repository of curated information on both genes and genetic phenotypes and the relationships between them. Each phenotype and gene is given a separate entry assigned a stable, unique identifier. The entries contain structured summaries of new and important information based on expert review of the biomedical literature. OMIM.org provides interactive access to the knowledge repository, including genomic coordinate searches of the gene map, views of genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes in Phenotypic Series, and side-by-side comparisons of clinical synopses. OMIM.org also supports computational queries via a robust API. All entries have extensive targeted links to other genomic resources and additional references. Updates to OMIM can be found on the update list or followed through the MIMmatch service. Updated user guides and tutorials are available on the website. As of September 2018, OMIM had over 24,600 entries, and the OMIM Morbid Map Scorecard had 6,259 molecularized phenotypes connected to 3,961 genes.",

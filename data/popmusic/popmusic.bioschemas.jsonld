  "sc:description": "MuSiC is a suite of programs that evaluate the biophysical effects of amino acid mutations in proteins. They request the experimental or modeled 3-dimensional protein structure as input, and predict the impact of specific single-site mutations requested by the user or of all possible single-site mutations.\n\nPoPMuSiC and HoTMuSiC predict the changes in thermodynamic and thermal stability, respectively, upon mutation.  They are helpful for the rational design of modified proteins with controlled stability properties. \n\nSNPMuSiC predicts whether protein variants are deleterious or benign due to stability issues, thus providing a molecular-level interpretation of disease phenotype.",

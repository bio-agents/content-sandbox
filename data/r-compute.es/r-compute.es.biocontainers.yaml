description: This package contains several functions for calculating the most widely
  used effect sizes (ES), along with their variances, confidence intervals and p-values.  The
  output includes ES's of d (mean difference), g (unbiased estimate of d), r (correlation
  coefficient), z' (Fisher's z), and OR (odds ratio and log odds ratio). In addition,
  NNT (number needed to treat), U3, CLES (Common Language Effect Size) and Cliff's
  Delta are computed. This package uses recommended formulas as described in The Handbook
  of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009).

  description: agents for comparing DNA sequences with MinHash sketches
  long_description: " Compute MinHash signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein\
    \ sequences.\n .\n MinHash sketches provide a lightweight way to store “signatures”\
    \ of large DNA\n or RNA sequence collections, and then compare or search them\
    \ using a Jaccard\n index. MinHash sketches can be used to identify samples, find\
    \ similar samples,\n identify data sets with shared sequences, and build phylogenetic\
    \ trees\n (Ondov et al. 2015).\n .\n sourmash provides a command line script,\
    \ a Python library, and a CPython\n module for MinHash sketches"

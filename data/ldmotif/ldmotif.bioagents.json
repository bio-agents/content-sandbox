                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Leucine-aspartic acid (LD) motifs are short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs) that link paxillin family proteins to factors controlling cell adhesion, motility and survival. The existence and importance of LD motifs beyond the paxillin family is poorly understood. Results: To enable a proteome-wide assessment of LD motifs, we developed an active learning based framework (LD motif finder; LDMF) that iteratively integrates computational predictions with experimental validation. Our analysis of the human proteome revealed a dozen new proteins containing LD motifs. We found that LD motif signalling evolved in unicellular eukaryotes more than 800 Myr ago, with paxillin and vinculin as core constituents, and nuclear export signal as a likely source of de novo LD motifs. We show that LD motif proteins form a functionally homogenous group, all being involved in cell morphogenesis and adhesion. This functional focus is recapitulated in cells by GFP-fused LD motifs, suggesting that it is intrinsic to the LD motif sequence, possibly through their effect on binding partners. Our approach elucidated the origin and dynamic adaptations of an ancestral SLiM, and can serve as a guide for the identification of other SLiMs for which only few representatives are known.

  description: Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads
  long_description: " FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fast\
    \ and\n accurate software agent to merge paired-end reads from next-generation\n\
    \ sequencing experiments. FLASH is designed to merge pairs of reads when\n the\
    \ original DNA fragments are shorter than twice the length of reads.\n The resulting\
    \ longer reads can significantly improve genome assemblies.\n They can also improve\
    \ transcriptome assembly when FLASH is used to merge\n RNA-seq data.\n"

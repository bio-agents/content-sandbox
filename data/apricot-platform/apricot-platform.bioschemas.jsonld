      "sc:description": "APRICOT (Advanced Platform for Reproducible Infrastructures in the Cloud via Open Agents) is an open-source extension to support customised virtual infrastructure deployment and usage from Jupyter notebooks.\nScientific publications are meant to exchange knowledge among researchers but the inability to properly reproduce computational experiments limits the quality of scientific research. Furthermore, bibliography shows that irreproducible preclinical research exceeds 50%, which produces a huge waste of resources on nonprofitable research at Life Sciences field. As a consequence, scientific reproducibility is being fostered to promote Open Science through open databases and software agents that are typically deployed on existing computational resources. However, some computational experiments require complex virtual infrastructures, such as elastic clusters of PCs, that can be dynamically provided from multiple clouds",

All rights reserved.Summary Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is a powerful method for analyzing complex mixtures of volatile compounds, but produces a large amount of raw data that requires downstream processing to align signals of interest (peaks) across multiple samples and match peak characteristics to reference standard libraries prior to downstream statistical analysis. Very few existing agents address this aspect of analysis and those that do have shortfalls in usability or performance. We have developed an R package that implements retention time and mass spectra similarity threshold-free alignments, seamlessly integrates retention time standards for universally reproducible alignments, performs common ion filtering and provides compatibility with multiple peak quantification methods. We demonstrate that our package's performance compares favorably to existing agents on a controlled mix of metabolite standards separated under variable chromatography conditions and data generated from cell lines. Availability and implementation R2DGC can be downloaded at https://github.com/rramaker/R2DGC or installed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

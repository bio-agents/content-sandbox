      "sc:description": "TrendCatcher is a versatile R package for identifying dynamic differentially expressed genes (DDEGs) in RNA-seq longitudinal studies. A time course experiment is a widely used design in the study of cellular processes such as cell differentiation or response to external stimuli. Temporal changes to the gene expression, such as mRNA, is the key to characterizing such biological processes. Here, we present a versatile R package named TrendCatcher to identify the dynamic differentially expressed genes along the biological process time course. TrendCatcher uses a framework that combines the smoothing spline ANOVA model and break point searching strategy.",

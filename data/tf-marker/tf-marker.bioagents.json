                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in biological processes and are usually used as cell markers. The emerging importance of TFs and related markers in identifying specific cell types in human diseases increases the need for a comprehensive collection of human TFs and related markers sets. Here, we developed the TF-Marker database (TF-Marker, http://bio.liclab.net/TF-Marker/), aiming to provide cell/tissue-specific TFs and related markers for human. By manually curating thousands of published literature, 5905 entries including information about TFs and related markers were classified into five types according to their functions: (i) TF: TFs which regulate expression of the markers; (ii) T Marker: markers which are regulated by the TF; (iii) I Marker: markers which influence the activity of TFs; (iv) TFMarker: TFs which play roles as markers and (v) TF Pmarker: TFs which play roles as potential markers. The 5905 entries of TF-Marker include 1316 TFs, 1092 T Markers, 473 I Markers, 1600 TFMarkers and 1424 TF Pmarkers, involving 383 cell types and 95 tissue types in human. TF-Marker further provides a user-friendly interface to browse, query and visualize the detailed information about TFs and related markers. We believe TF-Marker will become a valuable resource to understand the regulation patterns of different tissues and cells.",

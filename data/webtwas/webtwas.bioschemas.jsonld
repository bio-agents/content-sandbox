      "sc:description": "The webTWAS integrates large number of GWAS summary level data for disease, and this number will be constantly increasing according to our timely curation. The webTWAS calculates the causal genes using single tissue expression imputation (MetaXcan and FUSION) or cross-tissue expression imputation (UTMOST) methods. Users can compare causal relations on gene-level and trait-level across studies of distinct sample size or population. In addition, users can upload their own GWAS summary statistic data and select the model to perform the customed TWAS analysis. Currently, we provide six models and the number of models will also be constantly increasing according to the development of TWAS research. The objective of this database is to ensure that its convenience and precision for researchers to select and prioritize causal genes for further study. In addition, our web could popularize TWAS in analysis by letting users easily applying TWAS agents online.",

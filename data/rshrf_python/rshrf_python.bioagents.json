                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The Author(s)The hemodynamic response function (HRF) greatly influences the intra- and inter-subject variability of brain activation and connectivity, and might confound the estimation of temporal precedence in connectivity analyses, making its estimation necessary for a correct interpretation of neuroimaging studies. Additionally, the HRF shape itself is a useful local measure. However, most algorithms for HRF estimation are specific for task-related fMRI data, and only a few can be directly applied to resting-state protocols. Here we introduce rsHRF, a Matlab and Python agentbox that implements HRF estimation and deconvolution from the resting-state BOLD signal. We first provide an overview of the main algorithm, practical implementations, and then demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of rsHRF by validation experiments with a publicly available resting-state fMRI dataset. We also provide agents for statistical analyses and visualization. We believe that this agentbox may significantly contribute to a better analysis and understanding of the components and variability of BOLD signals.",

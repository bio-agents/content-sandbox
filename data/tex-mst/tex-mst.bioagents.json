Published by Oxford University Press.Recently, a new reference transcript dataset [Matched Annotation from the NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) select] was released by NCBI and EMBL-EBI to make available a new unified representative transcript for human protein-coding genes. While the main purpose of MANE project is to provide a harmonized gene and transcript information standard, there is no explicit tissue expression information about these MANE select transcripts. In this report, we tried to provide useful expression profiles of MANE select transcripts in various normal human tissues to allow further interrogation of their molecular modulations and functional significance. We obtained the new V9 transcript expression dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) web portal. This new GTEx dataset, based on a long-read sequencing platform, affords better assessment of the expression of alternative spliced transcripts. This tissue expression profiles of MANE select transcripts (TEx-MST) database not only provides the basic information of MANE select transcripts but also tissue expression profiles on alternative transcripts in protein-coding genes. Users can initiate the interrogation by gene symbol searches or by browsing the MANE genes with various criteria (such as genome locations or expression rankings). We further utilized the GENCODE biotype feature to identify the top-ranked protein-coding transcripts by choosing the most expressed protein-coding transcripts from GTEx datasets (both V8 and V9 datasets). In summary, there are 18 083 genes matched between MANE and GTEx. Among them, 13 245 MANE select transcripts matched with the top-ranked protein-coding transcripts in GTEx V9 dataset, which underlined the dominate expression of MANE select transcripts. This TEx-MST web bioinformatic database provides a visualized user interface for the normal tissue expression patterns of MANE select transcripts using the newly released GTEx dataset.

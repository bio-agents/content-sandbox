    "description": "Provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes for storing, manipulating and aggregating over annotated ranges of integers. Implements an algebra of range operations, including efficient algorithms for finding overlaps and nearest neighbors. Defines efficient list-like classes for storing, transforming and aggregating large grouped data, i.e., collections of atomic vectors and DataFrames.",

                "abstract": "We describe Bioconductor infrastructure for representing and computing on annotated genomic ranges and integrating genomic data with the statistical computing features of R and its extensions. At the core of the infrastructure are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures. These packages provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and coverage vectors. Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential expression analysis and visualization. Â© 2013 Lawrence et al.",

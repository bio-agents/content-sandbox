Published by BMJ.Objective To develop an easy-to-use R package and web application that summarises baseline characteristics across different arms of a clinical trial or different exposures. Methods Tables and figures are the efficient means of visualising, communicating and summarising data. It is common in comparative effectiveness research to provide a synopsis of characteristics and outcomes across the various treatment groups. The popularity of such a table has earned it a name and we simply call it the a € TableOne', as it is usually the first TableOne encounters looking at a published clinical trial. Such a table includes not only descriptive statistics for each group but also appropriate tests (p values and 95% CIs) for checking for differences across groups. We have developed an R package (called TableOne) (accessible through https://github.com/agapiospanos/TableOne) th at quickly summarises and compares results across different groups. We have also extended it to an online web application that is easily handled by the researcher. All computations are done in R and plots are produced using the plotly library. We provide a detailed description on how to use the web application. Results The application guides the user in a step by step format (wizard) and it is accessible through any browser in the following link (https://esm.uoi.gr/shiny/tableone/). Finally, appropriate interactive plots are provided for each variable. Conclusions This easy-to-use web application will help researchers quickly and easily to visualise differences across treatment groups or different exposures.",

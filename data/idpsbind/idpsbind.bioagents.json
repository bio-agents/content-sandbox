                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions but play crucial roles in many biological processes. Intrinsically disordered proteins perform various biological functions by interacting with other ligands. Results: Here, we present a database, IDPsBind, which displays interacting sites between IDPs and interacting ligands by using the distance threshold method in known 3D structure IDPs complexes from the PDB database. IDPsBind contains 9626 IDPs complexes and 880 intrinsically disordered proteins verified by experiments. The current release of the IDPsBind database is defined as version 1.0. IDPsBind is freely accessible at http://www.s-bioinformatics.cn/idpsbind/home/. Conclusions: IDPsBind provides more comprehensive interaction sites for IDPs complexes of known 3D structures. It can not only help the subsequent studies of the interaction mechanism of intrinsically disordered proteins but also provides a suitable background for developing the algorithms for predicting the interaction sites of intrinsically disordered proteins.",

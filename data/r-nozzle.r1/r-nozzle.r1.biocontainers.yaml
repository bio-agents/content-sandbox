description: The Nozzle package provides an API to generate HTML reports with dynamic
  user interface elements based on JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Nozzle
  was designed to facilitate summarization and rapid browsing of complex results in
  data analysis pipelines where multiple analyses are performed frequently on big
  data sets. The package can be applied to any project where user-friendly reports
  need to be created.

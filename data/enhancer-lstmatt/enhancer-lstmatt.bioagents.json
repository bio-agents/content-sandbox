                "abstract": "Â© 2022 by the authors.Enhancers are short DNA segments that play a key role in biological processes, such as accelerating transcription of target genes. Since the enhancer resides anywhere in a genome sequence, it is difficult to precisely identify enhancers. We presented a bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) and attention-based deep learning method (Enhancer-LSTMAtt) for enhancer recognition. Enhancer-LSTMAtt is an end-to-end deep learning model that consists mainly of deep residual neural network, Bi-LSTM, and feed-forward attention. We extensively compared the Enhancer-LSTMAtt with 19 state-of-the-art methods by 5-fold cross validation, 10-fold cross validation and independent test. Enhancer-LSTMAtt achieved competitive performances, especially in the independent test. We realized Enhancer-LSTMAtt into a user-friendly web application. Enhancer-LSTMAtt is applicable not only to recognizing enhancers, but also to distinguishing strong enhancer from weak enhancers. Enhancer-LSTMAtt is believed to become a promising agent for identifying enhancers.",

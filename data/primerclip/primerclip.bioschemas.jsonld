  "sc:description": "Primerclip™ is an alignment-based primer trimming agent designed to trim primer sequences for Swift Biosciences Accel-Amplicon™ panels. The motivation for designing an alignment-based primer trimming agent to increase speed. Primerclip uses an algorithm based on genomic intervals of the aligned reads rather than the sequence matching approach necessarily used by most trimming agents to trim adapter sequences. Trimming based on alignment position allows primerclip to run in significantly less time than sequence-based trim agents, particularly as the size of the targeted panel increases.",

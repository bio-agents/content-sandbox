description: A cross-platform r framework that facilitates processing of any number
  of affymetrix microarray samples regardless of computer system.  the only parameter
  that limits the number of chips that can be processed is the amount of available
  disk space.  the aroma framework has successfully been used in studies to process
  tens of thousands of arrays.  this package has actively been used since 2006.

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Research on RNA-associated interactions has exploded in recent years, and increasing numbers of studies are not limited to RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions but also include RNA-DNA/compound interactions. To facilitate the development of the interactome and promote understanding of the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of RNA, we updated RAID v2.0 to RNAInter (RNA Interactome Database), a repository for RNA-associated interactions that is freely accessible at http://www.rna-society.org/rnainter/or http://www.rna-society.org/raid/. Compared to RAID v2.0, new features in RNAInter include (i) 8-fold more interaction data and 94 additional species; (ii) more definite annotations organized, including RNA editing/localization/modification/structure and homology interaction; (iii) advanced functions including fuzzy/batch search, interaction network and RNA dynamic expression and (iv) four embedded RNA interactome agents: RIscoper, IntaRNA, PRIdictor and DeepBind. Consequently, RNAInter contains >41 million RNA-associated interaction entries, involving more than 450 thousand unique molecules, including RNA, protein, DNA and compound. Overall, RNAInter provides a comprehensive RNA interactome resource for researchers and paves the way to investigate the regulatory landscape of cellular RNAs.",

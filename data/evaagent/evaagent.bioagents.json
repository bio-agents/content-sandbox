For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying various small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) play a vital roles in cell communication and diseases. Correct quantification of multiple sncRNA biotypes simultaneously in EVs is a challenge due to the short reads (<30 bp) could be mapped to multiple sncRNA types. To address this question, we developed an optimized reads assignment algorithm (ORAA) to dynamically map multi-mapping reads to the sncRNA type with a higher proportion. We integrated ORAA with reads processing steps into EVAagent Python-package (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/EVAagent) to quantify sncRNAs, especially for sncRNA-seq from EV samples. EVAagent allows users to specify interested sncRNA types in advanced mode or use default seven sncRNAs (microRNA, small nucleolar RNA, PIWI-interacting RNAs, small nuclear RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA and Y RNA). To prove the utilities of EVAagent, we quantified the sncRNA expression profiles for 200 samples from cognitive decline and multiple sclerosis. We found that more than 20% of short reads on average were mapped to multiple sncRNA biotypes in multiple sclerosis. In cognitive decline, the proportion of Y RNA is significantly higher than other sncRNA types. EVAagent is a flexible and extensible agent that would benefit to mine potential biomarkers and functional molecules in EVs.",

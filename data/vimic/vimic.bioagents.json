    "description": "A Database of Human Disease-related Virus Mutations, Integration Sites and Cis-effects.\n\n Molecular mechanisms of virus-related diseases involve multiple factors, including viral mutation accumulation and integration of a viral genome into the host DNA. With increasing attention being paid to virus-mediated pathogenesis and the development of many useful technologies to identify virus mutations (VMs) and viral integration sites (VISs), abundant literatures on these topics are available in PubMed. However, knowledge of VMs and VISs is widely scattered in numerous published papers, and the association of VMs with VISs in the viral genome or the functional annotation of VISs still lacks integration and curation. To address these challenges, we built a database of human disease-related Vi rus M utations, I ntegration sites and C is-effects (ViMIC), which specialize in three features: virus mutation sites, viral integration sites and target genes",

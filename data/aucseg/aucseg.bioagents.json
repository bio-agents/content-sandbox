                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Ren, Yu, Yu, Peng and Zhang.The segmentation of high-grade gliomas (HGG) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is clinically meaningful in neurosurgical practice, but a challenging task. Currently, most segmentation methods are supervised learning with labeled training sets. Although these methods work well in most cases, they typically require time-consuming manual labeling and pre-trained models. In this work, we propose an automatically unsupervised segmentation agentbox based on the clustering algorithm and morphological processing, named AUCseg. With our agentbox, the whole tumor was first extracted by clustering on T2-FLAIR images. Then, based on the mask acquired with whole tumor segmentation, the enhancing tumor was segmented on the post-contrast T1-weighted images (T1-CE) using clustering methods. Finally, the necrotic regions were segmented by morphological processing or clustering on T2-weighted images. Compared with K-means, Mini-batch K-means, and Fuzzy C Means (FCM), the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering performs the best in our agentbox. We did a multi-sided evaluation of our agentbox in the BraTS2018 dataset and demonstrated that the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor can be automatically segmented using default hyper-parameters with Dice score 0.8209, 0.7087, and 0.7254, respectively. The computing time of our agentbox for each case is around 22 seconds, which is at least 3 times faster than other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. In addition, our agentbox has an option to perform semi-automatic segmentation via manually setup hyper-parameters, which could improve the segmentation performance. Our agentbox, AUCseg, is publicly available on Github. (https://github.com/Haifengtao/AUCseg).",

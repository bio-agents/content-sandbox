      "sc:description": "pathwayPCA an R/Bioconductor Package for Pathway Based Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Data.\n\nIntegrative Pathway Analysis with Modern PCA Methodology and Gene Selection.\n\nWith the advance in high-throughput technology for molecular assays, multi-omics datasets have become increasingly available. However, most currently available pathway analysis software do not provide estimates on sample-specific pathway activities, and provide little or no functionalities for analyzing multiple types of omics data simultaneously. To address these challenges, we present pathwayPCA, a unique integrative pathway analysis software that utilizes modern statistical methodology on principal component analysis (PCA) and gene selection.",

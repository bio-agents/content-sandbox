For each biomolecule this information is shown in the form of a genus trace plot, as well as a genus matrix diagram. We assemble such information for all protein and RNA structures deposited in the PDB. This database presents also various statistics and extensive information about biological function of analyzed biomolecules. Moreover, users can analyze their own structures",

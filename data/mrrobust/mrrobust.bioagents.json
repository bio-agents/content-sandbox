Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.Motivation: In recent years, Mendelian randomization analysis using summary data from genome-wide association studies has become a popular approach for investigating causal relationships in epidemiology. The mrrobust Stata package implements several of the recently developed methods. Implementation: mrrobust is freely available as a Stata package. General features: The package includes inverse variance weighted estimation, as well as a range of median, modal and MR-Egger estimation methods. Using mrrobust, plots can be constructed visualizing each estimate either individually or simultaneously. The package also provides statistics such as IGX2, which are useful in assessing attenuation bias in causal estimates. Availability: The software is freely available from GitHub [https://raw.github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust/master/].",

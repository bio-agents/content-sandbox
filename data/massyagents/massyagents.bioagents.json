                "abstract": "© 2015 American Chemical Society.The study of N-linked glycosylation has long been complicated by a lack of bioinformatics agents. In particular, there is still a lack of fast and robust data processing agents for targeted (relative) quantitation. We have developed modular, high-throughput data processing software, MassyAgents, that is capable of calibrating spectra, extracting data, and performing quality control calculations based on a user-defined list of glycan or glycopeptide compositions. Typical examples of output include relative areas after background subtraction, isotopic pattern-based quality scores, spectral quality scores, and signal-to-noise ratios. We demonstrated MassyAgents' performance on MALDI-TOF-MS glycan and glycopeptide data from different samples. MassyAgents yielded better calibration than the commercial software flexAnalysis, generally showing 2-fold better ppm errors after internal calibration. Relative quantitation using MassyAgents and flexAnalysis gave similar results, yielding a relative standard deviation (RSD) of the main glycan of ∼6%. However, MassyAgents yielded 2- to 5-fold lower RSD values for low-abundant analytes than flexAnalysis. Additionally, feature curation based on the computed quality criteria improved the data quality. In conclusion, we show that MassyAgents is a robust automated data processing agent for high-throughput, high-performance glycosylation analysis.

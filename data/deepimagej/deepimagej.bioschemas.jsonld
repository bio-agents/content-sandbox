Just edit, push, and your changes are live.\n\nDeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ and Fiji. The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer and does not require any deep learning expertise.",

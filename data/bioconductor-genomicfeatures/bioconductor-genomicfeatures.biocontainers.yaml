description: A set of agents and methods for making and manipulating transcript centric
  annotations. with these agents the user can easily download the genomic locations
  of the transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either the ucsc genome
  browser or a biomart database. this information is then stored in a local database
  that keeps track of the relationship between transcripts, exons, cds and genes.

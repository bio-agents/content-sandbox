                "abstract": "Â© 2022 International Union of Crystallography. All rights reserved.Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) has emerged as a revolutionary method for solving high-resolution structures and studying the dynamics of macromolecular complexes and viruses in near-native states. However, the availability of the equipment, and the time and cost needed for training, severely limit the opportunities for training. To solve these problems, a virtual reality-based training system, CryoVR, has been developed to prepare trainees before operating real-world cryoEM equipment. This paper describes the design and assessment of CryoVR (available at https://www.purdue.edu/cryoVR), which helps users learn cryoEM experimental procedures in a virtual environment, allowing immersive training with step-by-step tutorials with vivid visual, audio and text guidance. Implemented as a training step before a novice user interacts with the expensive real-world cryoEM equipment, CryoVR can help users to become familiar with hands-on operational procedures through multiple training modules and earning certificates after passing the built-in Exam mode. Qualitative evaluation and feedback of CryoVR from users with various levels of cryoEM experience indicate the substantial value of CryoVR as a agent for a comprehensive cryoEM procedural training.",

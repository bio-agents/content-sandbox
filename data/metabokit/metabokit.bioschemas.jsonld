      "sc:description": "A comprehensive data extraction agent for untargeted metabolomics.\n\nWe have developed MetaboKit, a comprehensive software package for compound identification and relative quantification in mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics analysis. In data dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis, MetaboKit constructs a customized spectral library with compound identities from reference spectral libraries, adducts, dimers, in-source fragments (ISF), MS MS fragmentation spectra, and more importantly the retention time information unique to the chromatography system used in the experiment. Using the customized library, the software performs targeted peak integration for precursor ions in DDA analysis and for precursor and product ions in data independent acquisition (DIA) analysis",

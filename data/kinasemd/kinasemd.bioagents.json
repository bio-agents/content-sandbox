Somatic mutations in kinase genes can affect drug treatment, both sensitivity and resistance, to clinically used kinase inhibitors. Here, we present a newly constructed database, KinaseMD (kinase mutations and drug response), to structurally and functionally annotate kinase mutations. KinaseMD integrates 679 374 somatic mutations, 251 522 network-rewiring events, and 390 460 drug response records curated from various sources for 547 kinases. We uniquely annotate the mutations and kinase inhibitor response in four types of protein substructures (gatekeeper, A-loop, G-loop and αC-helix) that are linked to kinase inhibitor resistance in literature. In addition, we annotate functional mutations that may rewire kinase regulatory network and report four phosphorylation signals (gain, loss, up-regulation and down-regulation). Overall, KinaseMD provides the most updated information on mutations, unique annotations of drug response especially drug resistance and functional sites of kinases. KinaseMD is accessible at https://bioinfo.uth.edu/kmd/, having functions for searching, browsing and downloading data. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic annotation of these structural mutations linking to kinase inhibitor response. In summary, KinaseMD is a centralized database for kinase mutations and drug response.",

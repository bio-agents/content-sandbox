      "sc:description": "A user-friendly web-based agent for molecule library selection and structure-based virtual screening.\n\nVirtual Screening in just a few clicks.\n\nEasyVS is a web-based platform built to simplify molecule library selection and virtual screening. With an intuitive interface, the agent allows users to go from selecting a protein target with a know structure and tailoring a purchasable molecule library to performing and visualising docking in a few clicks. Our system also allows users to filter screening libraries based on molecule properties, cluster molecules by similarity and personalise docking parameters.",

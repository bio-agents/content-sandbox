description: Concordance and discordance of homologous gene regulation allows comparing
  reaction to stimuli in different organisms, for example human patients and animal
  models of a disease. The package contains functions to calculate discordance and
  concordance score for homologous gene pairs, identify concordantly or discordantly
  regulated transcriptional modules and visualize the results. It is intended for
  analysis of transcriptional data.

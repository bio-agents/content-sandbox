Possible applications of the model are the prediction of photon transport in tissues, blood samples, clouds, smoke, fog, turbid liquids, spray systems, etc. As the simulations are run from a computer server at the Department of Physics at Lund University, any researcher can log in and use it freely without any programming skills or requirements for any software/hardware installations.",

      "sc:description": "a platform of ratiometric bioluminescent sensors for homogeneous immunoassays.\n\nAbstract Heterogeneous immunoassays such as ELISA have become indispensable in modern bioanalysis, yet translation into easy-to-use point-of-care assays is hindered by their dependence on external calibration and multiple washing and incubation steps. Here, we introduce RAPPID ( Ra tiometric P lug-and- P lay Immuno d iagnostics), a “mix-and-measure” homogeneous immunoassay platform that combines highly specific antibody-based detection with a ratiometric bioluminescent readout that can be detected using a basic digital camera. The concept entails analyte-induced complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase fragments, photoconjugated to an antibody sandwich pair via protein G adapters. We also introduce the use of a calibrator luciferase that provides a robust ratiometric signal, allowing direct in-sample calibration and quantitative measurements in complex media such as blood plasma",

description: 'Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e. it aims to put corresponding
  features at the same locations. The algorithm searches for an optimal polynomial
  describing the warping. It is possible to align one sample to a reference, several
  samples to the same reference, or several samples to several references. One can
  choose between calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set
  of samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented: RMS (Root
  Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both warping of peak profiles
  and of peak lists are supported.'

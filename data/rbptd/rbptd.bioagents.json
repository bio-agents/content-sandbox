Published by Oxford University Press.RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in human physiological and pathological processes, especially in cancers. Many RBPs have been found to be dysregulated in cancers; however, there was no agent to incorporate high-throughput data from different dimensions to systematically identify cancer-related RBPs and to explore their causes of abnormality and their potential functions. Therefore, we developed a database named RBPTD to identify cancer-related RBPs in humans and systematically explore their functions and abnormalities by integrating different types of data, including gene expression profiles, prognosis data and DNA copy number variation (CNV), among 28 cancers. We found a total of 454 significantly differentially expressed RBPs, 1970 RBPs with significant prognostic value, and 53 dysregulated RBPs correlated with CNV abnormality. Functions of 26 cancer-related RBPs were explored by analysing high-throughput RNA sequencing data obtained by crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and the remaining RBP functions were predicted by calculating their correlation coefficient with other genes. Finally, we developed the RBPTD for users to explore functions and abnormalities of cancer-related RBPs to improve our understanding of their roles in tumorigenesis.

      "sc:description": "a library for stochastic simulation of complex biochemical reactions.\n\nThe Java-based implementation of the rejection-based stochastic simulation algorithm (RSSA) and a wide range of its improvements to accelerate the simulation and analysis of biochemical reactions. The simulation library supports reactions with complex kinetics and time delays, necessary to model complexities of reaction mechanisms. RSSALib provides both an application program interface (API) and a graphic user interface (GUI) to ease the set-up and visualization of the simulation results.",

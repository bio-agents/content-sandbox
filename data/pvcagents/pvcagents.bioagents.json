    "description": "parallel variation calling agents.\n\nPVCAgents is Parallel Variation Calling Agents, which tries to call variation using multiple threads. Basically, the reference genome will be splited into small pieces, and corresponding alignment BAM files will be extracted. Under this way, it will speed up the process of variation calling a lot",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019As the development of sequencing technology, it is now possible to sequence individuals of each species. Although a number of different agents have been developed to detect individual variations, most of them cannot be run in parallel modes. To accelerate variation detection, PVCAgents is introduced in this study. PVCAgents splits the reference genome and alignment files into small pieces and runs them in parallel mode. Meanwhile, boundary noise is also considered in PVCAgents. From the result of three different sets of test data, PVCAgents performs much faster than most other current agents. At the same time, it keeps similar accuracy with other agents. PVCAgents is free and open source software. The development of sequencing technology and growing sample numbers will make performance improvements such as PVCAgents increasingly interesting.",

                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRN) is an essential component of systems biology, and there is a constant development of new inference methods. The most common approach to assess accuracy for publications is to benchmark the new method against a selection of existing algorithms. This often leads to a very limited comparison, potentially biasing the results, which may stem from tuning the benchmark's properties or incorrect application of other methods. These issues can be avoided by a web server with a broad range of data properties and inference algorithms, that makes it easy to perform comprehensive benchmarking of new methods, and provides a more objective assessment. Here we present https://GRNbenchmark.org/ - a new web server for benchmarking GRN inference methods, which provides the user with a set of benchmarks with several datasets, each spanning a range of properties including multiple noise levels. As soon as the web server has performed the benchmarking, the accuracy results are made privately available to the user via interactive summary plots and underlying curves. The user can then download these results for any purpose, and decide whether or not to make them public to share with the community.",

    "description": "FastBMD is an online agent for rapid benchmark dose-response analysis of transcriptomics data. FastBMD is a computationally efficient implementation of the National Toxicology Program Approach to Genomic Dose-Response Modeling. Key features include a simplified workflow, ability to download results at each step, and interactive exploration of pathway-level BMDs. In addition to model organisms, FastBMD is designed to support non-model organisms by enabling an annotation-free pipeline that includes feature sensitivity-based point-of-departure analysis. The final part of the analysis is designed to allow users to interactively explore BMDs at different levels of organization:.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Transcriptomics dose-response analysis is a promising new approach method for toxicity testing. While international regulatory agencies have spent substantial effort establishing a standardized statistical approach, existing software that follows this approach is computationally inefficient and must be locally installed. Results: FastBMD is a web-based agent that implements standardized methods for transcriptomics benchmark dose-response analysis in R. It is >60 times faster than the current leading software, supports transcriptomics data from 13 species, and offers a comprehensive analytical pipeline that goes from processing and normalization of raw gene expression values to interactive exploration of pathway-level benchmark dose results.",

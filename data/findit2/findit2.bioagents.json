                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Transcription factors (TFs) play central roles in regulating gene expression. With the rapid growth in the use of high-throughput sequencing methods, there is a need to develop a comprehensive data processing and analyzing framework for inferring influential TFs based on ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq datasets. Results: Here, we introduce FindIT2 (Find Influential TFs and Targets), an R/Bioconductor package for annotating and processing high-throughput multi-omics data. FindIT2 supports a complete framework for annotating ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq peaks, identifying TF targets by the combination of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets, and inferring influential TFs based on different types of data input. Moreover, benefited from the annotation framework based on Bioconductor, FindIT2 can be applied to any species with genomic annotations, which is particularly useful for the non-model species that are less well-studied. Conclusion: FindIT2 provides a user-friendly and flexible framework to generate results at different levels according to the richness of the annotation information of user’s species. FindIT2 is compatible with all the operating systems and is released under Artistic-2.0 License.

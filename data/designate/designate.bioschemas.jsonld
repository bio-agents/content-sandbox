The analysis is based on a novel representation of the gene sequence data, which enables a ranking of all positions according to their diagnostic relevance and a classification of the characters. DeSignate is also able to detect diagnostic combinations of characters. The agent guides the user step-by-step through the analysis and presents the results without need to post-process the output data.",

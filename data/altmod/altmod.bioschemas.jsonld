      "sc:description": "Revisiting the \"satisfaction of spatial restraints\" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling.\n\naltMOD is a MODELLER (https://salilab.org/modeller/) [1] plugin for improved 3D homology model building. Right now, it allows to incorporate in the program's objective function terms for interatomic distances statistical potentials, such as DOPE [2] and DFIRE [3]. The effect of adding statistical potentials in the objective function of MODELLER is described in Revisiting the \"satisfaction of spatial restraints\" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling\" (Janson et al., 2019). In a benchmark with 225 single-template homology models, we found that the inclusion of DOPE in the objective function of MODELLER brings an average improvement of 1.3% and 2.0% in GDT-HA [4] and lDDT [5] and a large improvement of -29.8% in MolProbity scores [6]",

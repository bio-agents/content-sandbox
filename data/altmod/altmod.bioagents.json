    "description": "Revisiting the \"satisfaction of spatial restraints\" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling.\n\naltMOD is a MODELLER (https://salilab.org/modeller/) [1] plugin for improved 3D homology model building. Right now, it allows to incorporate in the program's objective function terms for interatomic distances statistical potentials, such as DOPE [2] and DFIRE [3]. The effect of adding statistical potentials in the objective function of MODELLER is described in Revisiting the \"satisfaction of spatial restraints\" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling\" (Janson et al., 2019). In a benchmark with 225 single-template homology models, we found that the inclusion of DOPE in the objective function of MODELLER brings an average improvement of 1.3% and 2.0% in GDT-HA [4] and lDDT [5] and a large improvement of -29.8% in MolProbity scores [6]",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The most frequently used approach for protein structure prediction is currently homology modeling. The 3D model building phase of this methodology is critical for obtaining an accurate and biologically useful prediction. The most widely employed agent to perform this task is MODELLER. This program implements the “modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints” strategy and its core algorithm has not been altered significantly since the early 1990s. In this work, we have explored the idea of modifying MODELLER with two effective, yet computationally light strategies to improve its 3D modeling performance. Firstly, we have investigated how the level of accuracy in the estimation of structural variability between a target protein and its templates in the form of σ values profoundly influences 3D modeling. We show that the σ values produced by MODELLER are on average weakly correlated to the true level of structural divergence between target-template pairs and that increasing this correlation greatly improves the program’s predictions, especially in multiple-template modeling. Secondly, we have inquired into how the incorporation of statistical potential terms (such as the DOPE potential) in the MODELLER’s objective function impacts positively 3D modeling quality by providing a small but consistent improvement in metrics such as GDT-HA and lDDT and a large increase in stereochemical quality. Python modules to harness this second strategy are freely available at https://github.com/pymodproject/altmod. In summary, we show that there is a large room for improving MODELLER in terms of 3D modeling quality and we propose strategies that could be pursued in order to further increase its performance.",

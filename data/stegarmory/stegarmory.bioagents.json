    "description": "Offensive Cyber Security Software for Embedding Shellcode in Images.\n\nStegArmory is an image-based steganography utility that can be used to embed and extract data from PNG images. StegArmory currently supports least significant bit (LSB) and pixel value differencing (PVD) encoding techniques. StegArmory was meant to embed and extract/execute shellcode payloads from images, though time-constraints didn't allow that feature of the project to be fully developed - this is left as an exercise for the user.",

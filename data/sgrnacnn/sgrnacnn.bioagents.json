Abstract: As an important component of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) plays an important role in gene redirection and editing. sgRNA has played an important role in the improvement of agronomic species, but there is a lack of effective bioinformatics agents to identify the activity of sgRNA in agronomic species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method based on machine learning to identify sgRNA high on-target activity. In this work, we proposed a simple convolutional neural network method to identify sgRNA high on-target activity. Our study used one-hot encoding and k-mers for sequence data conversion and a voting algorithm for constructing the convolutional neural network ensemble model sgRNACNN for the prediction of sgRNA activity. The ensemble model sgRNACNN was used for predictions in four crops: Glycine max, Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Triticum aestivum. The accuracy rates of the four crops in the sgRNACNN model were 82.43%, 80.33%, 78.25% and 87.49%, respectively. The experimental results showed that sgRNACNN realizes the identification of high on-target activity sgRNA of agronomic data and can meet the demands of sgRNA activity prediction in agronomy to a certain extent. These results have certain significance for guiding crop gene editing and academic research.

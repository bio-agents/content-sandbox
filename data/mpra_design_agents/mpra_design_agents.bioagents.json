For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Genetic reporter assays are a convenient, relatively inexpensive method for studying the regulation of gene expression. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) are high-throughput functionalization assays that interrogate the transcriptional activity of many genetic variants at once using a library of synthetic barcoded constructs. Despite growing interest in this area, there are few computational agents to design and execute MPRA studies. Results: We designed an online web-agent and R package that allows for interactive MPRA experimental design encompassing both power analysis and design of constructs. Our agent is tuned using data from real MPRA studies. Users can adjust experimental parameters to examine the predicted effect on assay power as well as upload VCFs for automated construct sequence generation.",

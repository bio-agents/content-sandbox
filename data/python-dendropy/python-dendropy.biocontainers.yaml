description: DendroPy is a Python library for phylogenetic computing. It provides
  classes and functions for the simulation, processing, and manipulation of phylogenetic
  trees and character matrices, and supports the reading and writing of phylogenetic
  data in a range of formats, such as NEXUS, NEWICK, NeXML, Phylip, FASTA, etc. Application
  scripts for performing some useful phylogenetic operations, such as data conversion
  and tree posterior distribution summarization, are also distributed and installed
  as part of the libary. DendroPy can thus function as a stand-alone library for phylogenetics,
  a component of more complex multi-library phyloinformatic pipelines, or as a scripting
  "glue" that assembles and drives such pipelines.

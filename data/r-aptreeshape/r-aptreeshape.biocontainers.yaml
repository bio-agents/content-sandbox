description: Simulation and analysis of phylogenetic tree topologies using statistical
  indices. It is a companion library of the 'ape' package. It provides additional
  functions for reading, plotting, manipulating phylogenetic trees. It also offers
  convenient web-access to public databases, and enables testing null models of macroevolution
  using corrected test statistics.  Trees of class "phylo" (from 'ape' package) can
  be converted easily. Implements methods described in Bortolussi et al. (2005) and
  Maliet et al. (2017).

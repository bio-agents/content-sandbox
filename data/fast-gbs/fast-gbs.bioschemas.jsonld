      "sc:description": "Fast-GBS is an analysis agentkit for genotyping-by-sequencing data. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a rapid, flexible, low-cost, and robust genotyping method that simultaneously discovers variants and calls genotypes within a broad range of samples. These characteristics make GBS an excellent agent for many applications and research questions from conservation biology to functional genomics in both model and non-model species. Continued improvement of GBS relies on a more comprehensive understanding of data analysis, development of fast and efficient bioinformatics pipelines, accurate missing data imputation, and active post-release support.",

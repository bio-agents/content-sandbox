Bayesian analyses are conducted with JAGS (BUGS code is automatically generated by the package based on the user’s inputs.) Outputs are highly customizable and include network plots, tables of network characteristics, data plots, league tables and league heat plots, SUCRA plots, rankograms, forest plots, leverage plots, traceplots and posterior mean deviance comparison plots",

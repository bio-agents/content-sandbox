      "sc:description": "Predicting the Sites of Metabolism in Synthetic Compounds and Natural Products for Phase 1 and Phase 2 Metabolic Enzymes | In this work we present the third generation of FAst MEtabolizer (FAME 3), a collection of extra trees classifiers for the prediction of sites of metabolism (SoMs) in small molecules such as drugs, druglike compounds, natural products, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. FAME 3 was derived from the MetaQSAR database ( Pedretti et al. J. Med. Chem. 2018 , 61 , 1019 ), a recently published data resource on xenobiotic metabolism that contains more than 2100 substrates annotated with more than 6300 experimentally confirmed SoMs related to redox reactions, hydrolysis and other nonredox reactions, and conjugation reactions",

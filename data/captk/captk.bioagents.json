                "abstract": "Â© 2020 by American Society of Clinical OncologyPURPOSE To construct a multi-institutional radiomic model that supports upfront prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and recurrence pattern (RP) in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at the time of initial diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified data for patients with newly diagnosed GBM from two institutions (institution 1, n = 65; institution 2, n = 15) who underwent gross total resection followed by standard adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, with pathologically confirmed recurrence, sufficient follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to reliably determine PFS, and available presurgical multiparametric MRI (MP-MRI). The advanced software suite Cancer Imaging Phenomics Agentkit (CaPTk) was leveraged to analyze standard clinical brain MP-MRI scans. A rich set of imaging features was extracted from the MP-MRI scans acquired before the initial resection and was integrated into two distinct imaging signatures for predicting mean shorter or longer PFS and near or distant RP. The predictive signatures for PFS and RP were evaluated on the basis of different classification schemes: single-institutional analysis, multi-institutional analysis with random partitioning of the data into discovery and replication cohorts, and multi-institutional assessment with data from institution 1 as the discovery cohort and data from institution 2 as the replication cohort. RESULTS These predictors achieved cross-validated classification performance (ie, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.88 (single-institution analysis) and 0.82 to 0.83 (multi-institution analysis) for prediction of PFS and 0.88 (single-institution analysis) and 0.56 to 0.71 (multi-institution analysis) for prediction of RP. CONCLUSION Imaging signatures of presurgical MP-MRI scans reveal relatively high predictability of time and location of GBM recurrence, subject to the patients receiving standard first-line chemoradiation therapy. Through its graphical user interface, CaPTk offers easy accessibility to advanced computational algorithms for deriving imaging signatures predictive of clinical outcome and could similarly be used for a variety of radiomic and radiogenomic analyses.",

OpenEBench is part of the IECHOR Agents platform and its development is led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in collaboration with partners within IECHOR and beyond. OpenEBench, holds a specific infrastructure to monitor software quality. In an initial analysis phase BSC has put together a series of quality metrics taken from a number of sources. The source of such metrics includes documents by the Software Sustainability Institute, recommendations for open source software development, or for software quality metrics. For each metric, a specific source of information have been chosen and the necessary interface implemented.",

    "description": "Breakpointer is a fast agent for locating sequence breakpoints from the alignment of single end reads (SE) produced by next generation sequencing (NGS). It adopts a heuristic method in searching for local mapping signatures created by insertion/deletions (indels) or more complex structural variants(SVs). With current NGS single-end sequencing data, the output regions by Breakpoint mainly contain the approximate breakpoints of indels and a limited number of large SVs.",

By taking advantage of local non-uniform read distribution and misalignments created by SVs, Breakpointer scans the alignment of single-end reads to identify regions containing potential breakpoints. The detection of such breakpoints can indicate insertions longer than the read length and SVs located in repetitve regions which might be missd by other methods. Thus, Breakpointer complements existing methods to locate SVs from single-end reads. Â© The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",

description: MultiBaC is a strategy to correct batch effects from multiomic datasets
  distributed across different labs or data acquisition events. MultiBaC is the first
  Batch effect correction algorithm that dealing with batch effect correction in multiomics
  datasets. MultiBaC is able to remove batch effects across different omics generated
  within separate batches provided that at least one common omic data type is included
  in all the batches considered.

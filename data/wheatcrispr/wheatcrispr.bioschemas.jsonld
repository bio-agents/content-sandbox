      "sc:description": "a web-based guide RNA design agent for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in wheat.\n\nBACKGROUND:CRISPR Cas9 gene editing has become a revolutionary technique for crop improvement as it can facilitate fast and efficient genetic changes without the retention of transgene components in the final plant line. Lack of robust bioinformatics agents to facilitate the design of highly specific functional guide RNAs (gRNAs) and prediction of off-target sites in wheat is currently an obstacle to effective application of CRISPR technology to wheat improvement. DESCRIPTION:We have developed a web-based bioinformatics agent to design specific gRNAs for genome editing and transcriptional regulation of gene expression in wheat",

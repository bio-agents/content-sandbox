    "description": "For life science research infrastructures, sensitive data generate an additional layer of complexity. Cross-domain categorisation and discovery of digital resources related to sensitive data presents major interoperability challenges. \n\nTo support the FAIRification process, a agentbox demonstrator aiming at improving the discovery of digital objects related to sensitive data (e.g., regulations, guidelines, best practice, agents) has been developed. The agentbox is based upon a categorisation system developed and harmonised across a cluster of 6 life science research infrastructures (ECRIN, EATRIS, BBMRI, ERINHA, EMBRC, Euro-BioImaging).\n\n3 different versions were built, tested by subsequent pilot studies, finally leading to a system with 7 main categories (sensitive data type, resource type, research field, data type, stage in data sharing life cycle, geographical scope, specific topics).",

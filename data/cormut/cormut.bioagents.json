    "description": "Provides functions for computing kaks for individual sites or specific amino acids and detecting correlated mutations among them. Three methods are provided for detecting correlated mutations, including conditional selection pressure, mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation consists of two steps: First, the positive selection sites are detected; Second, the mutation correlations are computed among the positive selection sites. Note that the first step is optional.",

                "abstract": "Correlated mutations constitute a fundamental idea in evolutionary biology, and understanding correlated mutations will, in turn, facilitate an understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing evolution. CorMut is an R package designed to compute correlated mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. Three classical methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks. CorMut also enables the comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolutionary conditions. Â© 2014 The Author 2014.",

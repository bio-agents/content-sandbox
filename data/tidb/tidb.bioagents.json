                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.Trained immunity is a newly emerging concept that defines the ability of the innate immune system to form immune memory and provide long-lasting protection against previously encountered antigens. Accumulating evidence reveals that trained immunity not only has broad benefits to host defense but is also harmful to the host in chronic inflammatory diseases. However, all trained immunity-related information is scattered in the literature and thus is difficult to access. Here, we describe Trained Immunity DataBase (TIDB), a comprehensive database that provides well-studied trained immunity-related genes from human, rat and mouse as well as the related literature evidence. Moreover, TIDB also provides three modules to analyze the function of the trained-immunity-related genes of interest, including Reactome pathway over-representation analysis, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction subnetwork reconstruction. We believe TIDB will help developing valuable strategies for vaccine design and immune-mediated disease therapy. Database URL: http://www.ieom-tm.com/tidb",

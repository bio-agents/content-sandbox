                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Circular RNA is a type of non-coding RNA, which has a circular structure. Many circular RNAs are stable and contain exons, but are not translated into proteins. Circular RNA has important functions in gene regulation and plays an important role in some human diseases. Several biological methods, such as RNase R treatment, have been developed to identify circular RNA. Multiple bioinformatics agents have also been developed for circular RNA detection with high-throughput sequence data. Results: In this paper, we present circDBG, a new method for circular RNA detection with de Bruijn graph. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of CircDBG based on both simulated and real data. Our results show that CircDBG finds more reliable circRNA with low bias, has more efficiency in running time, and performs better in balancing accuracy and sensitivity than existing methods. As a byproduct, we also introduce a new method to classify circular RNAs based on reads alignment. Finally, we report a potential chimeric circular RNA that is found by CircDBG based on real sequence data. CircDBG can be downloaded from https://github.com/lxwgcool/CircDBG. Conclusions: We develop a new method called CircDBG for circular RNA detection, which is based on de Bruijn graph. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate CircDBG outperforms existing agents, especially in saving running time, reducing bias and improving capability of balancing accuracy and sensitivity. We also introduce a new method to classify circular RNAs and report a potential case of chimeric circular RNA.",

    "description": "CONREL is a genome browser that allows for the exploration of consensus regulatory elements at different levels of abstraction. The total binding affinity of transcription factors on whole consensus region sequences is here fully exploited to characterize and annotate functional properties of regulatory elements. CONREL can be used to explore genomic loci, genes or genomic regions of interest across different cell lines and tissues.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Understanding the interaction between human genome regulatory elements and transcription factors is fundamental to elucidate the structure of gene regulatory networks. Here we present CONREL, a web application that allows for the exploration of functionally annotated transcriptional 'consensus' regulatory elements at different levels of abstraction. CONREL provides an extensive collection of consensus promoters, enhancers and active enhancers for 198 cell-lines across 38 tissue types, which are also combined to provide global consensuses. In addition, 1000 Genomes Project genotype data and the 'total binding affinity' of thousands of transcription factor binding motifs at genomic regulatory elements is fully combined and exploited to characterize and annotate functional properties of our collection. Comparison with other available resources highlights the strengths and advantages of CONREL. CONREL can be used to explore genomic loci, specific genes or genomic regions of interest across different cell lines and tissue types. The resource is freely available at https://bcglab.cibio.unitn.it/conrel.",

description: Split multiple fastq files by matching barcodes in one or more of the
  sequence files. barcodes in the tab-delimited barcodes.txt file are matched against
  the beginning (or end) of the specified index read(s). by default, barcodes must
  match exactly, but --mistmatches can be set higher if desired. compressed input
  is read (from all files) if the first input file name ends in .gz. reading of compressed
  input can be forced with the gzipin option.

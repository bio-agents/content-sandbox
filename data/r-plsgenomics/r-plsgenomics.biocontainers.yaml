description: 'Routines for PLS-based genomic analyses, implementing PLS methods for
  classification with microarray data and prediction of transcription factor activities
  from combined ChIP-chip analysis. The >=1.2-1 versions include two new classification
  methods for microarray data: GSIM and Ridge PLS. The >=1.3 versions includes a new
  classification method combining variable selection and compression in logistic regression
  context: logit-SPLS; and an adaptive version of the sparse PLS.'

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: High-throughput screening (HTS) is a vital automation technology in biomedical research in both industry and academia. The well-known Z-factor has been widely used as a gatekeeper to assure assay quality in an HTS study. However, many researchers and users may not have realized that Z-factor has major issues. Results: In this article, the following four major issues are explored and demonstrated so that researchers may use the Z-factor appropriately. First, the Z-factor violates the Pythagorean theorem of statistics. Second, there is no adjustment of sampling error in the application of the Z-factor for quality control (QC) in HTS studies. Third, the expectation of the sample-based Z-factor does not exist. Fourth, the thresholds in the Z-factor-based criterion lack a theoretical basis. Here, an approach to avoid these issues was proposed and new QC criteria under homoscedasticity were constructed so that researchers can choose a statistically grounded criterion for QC in the HTS studies. We implemented this approach in an R package and demonstrated its utility in multiple CRISPR/CAS9 or siRNA HTS studies.",

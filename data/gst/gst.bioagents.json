This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Whole-exome sequencing (WES) can identify causative mutations in hereditary diseases. However, WES data might have a large candidate variant list, including false positives. Moreover, in families, it is more difficult to select disease-associated variants because many variants are shared among members. To reduce false positives and extract accurate candidates, we used a multilocus variant instead of a single-locus variant (SNV). We set up a specific window to analyze the multilocus variant and devised a sliding-window approach to observe all variants. We developed the gene selection agent (GST) based on proportion tests for linkage analysis using WES data. This agent is R program coded and has high sensitivity. We tested our code to find the gene for hereditary spastic paraplegia using SNVs from a specific family and identified the gene known to cause the disease in a significant gene list. The list identified other genes that might be associated with the disease.",

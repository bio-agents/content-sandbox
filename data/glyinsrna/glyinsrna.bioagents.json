                "abstract": "Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Versatile RNA modifications play important roles in post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression, among which glycosylation modifications on small RNAs emerge as a novel clade whose characteristics need further interrogations. Here, we demonstrated that the sequence pattern around RNA glycosylation sites was not random and could be exploited for glycosylation site prediction. A machine learning predictor, GlyinsRNA, which integrated multiple RNA sequence representation encodings, was established. GlyinsRNA achieved AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.7933 and 0.7979 in five-fold cross-validation and independent tests, respectively. GlyinsRNA was implemented as an online webserver, where both the predicted glycosylation sites and the overrepresented RNA-binding protein (RBP)-related motifs were annotated to facilitate the users. GlyinsRNA webserver is freely available at http://www.rnanut.net/glyinsrna.",

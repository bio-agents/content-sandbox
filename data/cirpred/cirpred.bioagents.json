Although CP has been applied in many fields, its implementation is still costly because of inevitable trials and errors. Results: Here we present CirPred, a structure modeling and termini linker design method for circularly permuted proteins. Compared with state-of-the-art protein structure modeling methods, CirPred is the only one fully capable of both circularly-permuted modeling and traditional co-linear modeling. CirPred performs well when the permutant shares low sequence identity with the native protein and even when the permutant adopts a different conformation from the native protein because of three-dimensional (3D) domain swapping. Linker redesign experiments demonstrated that the linker design algorithm of CirPred achieved subangstrom accuracy. Conclusions: The CirPred system is capable of (1) predicting the structure of circular permutants, (2) designing termini linkers, (3) performing traditional co-linear protein structure modeling, and (4) identifying the CP-induced occurrence of 3D domain swapping. This method is supposed helpful for broadening the application of CP, and its web server is available at http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/CirPred/ and http://lo.life.nctu.edu.tw/CirPred/.",

      "sc:description": "CirPred is a structure modeling and linker design system for circularly permuted proteins. It is a protein engineering techniques based on a structural rearrangement phenomenon called circular permutation (CP), equivalent to connecting the native termini of a protein followed by creating new termini at another site. Although CP has been applied in many fields, its implementation is still costly because of inevitable trials and errors. Compared with state-of-the-art protein structure modeling methods, CirPred is the only one fully capable of both circularly-permuted modeling and traditional co-linear modeling.",

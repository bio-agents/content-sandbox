                "abstract": "Â© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Genomic interaction studies use next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine the interactions between two loci on the genome, with subsequent bioinformatics analyses typically including annotation, intersection, and merging of data from multiple experiments. While many file types and analysis agents exist for storing and manipulating single locus NGS data, there is currently no file standard or analysis agent suite for manipulating and storing paired-genomic-loci: the data type resulting from \"genomic interaction\" studies. As genomic interaction sequencing data are becoming prevalent, a standard file format and agents for working with these data conveniently and efficiently are needed. Results: This article details a file standard and novel software agent suite for working with paired-genomic-loci data. We present the paired-genomic-loci (PGL) file standard for genomic-interactions data, and the accompanying analysis agent suite \"pglagents\": a cross platform, pypy compatible python package available both as an easy-to-use UNIX package, and as a python module, for integration into pipelines of paired-genomic-loci analyses. Conclusions: Pglagents is a freely available, open source agent suite for manipulating paired-genomic-loci data. Source code, an in-depth manual, and a tutorial are available publicly at www.github.com/billgreenwald/pglagents , and a python module of the operations can be installed from PyPI via the PyGLagents module.",

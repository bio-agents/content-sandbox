      "sc:description": "Improving score-based motif enrichment by incorporating sequence bias covariates.\n\nMotif Enrichment In Ranked Lists Of Peaks.\n\nThis project analyzes the relative enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs found in peaks at the top or bottom of a given ranking/score. It does this by calculating motif enrichment using a logistic regression model that describes the likelihood of a motif being present in sequences with higher/lower scores, while accounting for the effect of multiple covariates. The design is based on MOODS and statsmodels.\n\nTo get started using MEIRLOP, see our documentation, which gives you a quick idea of what goes into and out of MEIRLOP so you can use it for your own experiments. For a full usage example that downloads and generates all the data it needs on the fly, see our walkthrough, which recreates commands and output for the section \"MEIRLOP identifies enriched TF binding motifs in DNase I Hypersensitive Sites\" from the MEIRLOP manuscript.",

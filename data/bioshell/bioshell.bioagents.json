                "abstract": "Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.BioShell is an open-source package for processing biological data, particularly focused on structural applications. The package provides parsers, data structures and algorithms for handling and analyzing macromolecular sequences, structures and sequence profiles. The most frequently used routines are accessible by a set of easy-to-use command line utilities for a Linux environment. The full functionality of the package assumes knowledge of C++ or Python to assemble an application using this software library. Since the last publication that announced the version 2.0, the package has been greatly expanded and rewritten in C++ standard 11 (C++11) to improve its modularity and efficiency. A new testing platform has been implemented to continuously test the correctness and integrity of the package. More than two hundred test programs have been published to provide simple examples that can be used as templates. This makes BioShell an easy to use library that greatly speeds up development of bioinformatics applications and web services without compromising computational efficiency.",

      "sc:description": "RetroRules is a database of reaction rules for metabolic pathway discovery and metabolic engineering. RetroRules provides a complete set of reaction rules, extracted from public databases and expressed in the community-standard SMARTS format, augmented by a rule representation at different levels of specificity (the atomic environment around the reaction center). Such multiple representation of reactions expands natural chemical diversity by predicting de novo reactions of promiscuous enzymes. Our rules are readily usable by open source cheminformatics agents such as RDKit as well as more complex retrosynthetic codes such as RetroPath2.0.",

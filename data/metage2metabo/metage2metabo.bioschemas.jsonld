It uses Pathway Agents in a automatic and parallel way to reconstruct metabolic networks for a large number of genomes. The obtained metabolic networks are then analyzed individually and collectively in order to get the added value of metabolic cooperation in microbiota over individual metabolism and to identify and screen interesting organisms among all.\n\nm2m â€” metage2metabo documentation.\n\nFree document hosting provided by Read the Docs",

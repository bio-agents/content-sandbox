The present work proposes the development of a new high precision system that allows the recognition of amino acid sequences of the nitrogenase enzyme (NifH) as a promising way to improve the identification of diazotrophic bacteria. For this purpose, a database obtained from UniProt built a processed dataset formed by a set of 4911 and 4782 amino acid sequences of the NifH and non-NifH proteins respectively. Subsequently, the feature extraction was developed using two methodologies: (i) k-mers counting and (ii) embedding layers to obtain numerical vectors of the amino acid chains. Afterward, for the embedding layer, the data was crossed by an external trainable convolutional layer, which received a uniform matrix and applied convolution using filters to obtain the feature maps of the model. Finally, a deep neural network was used as the primary model to classify the amino acid sequences as NifH protein or not. Performance evaluation experiments were carried out, and the results revealed an accuracy of 96.4%, a sensitivity of 95.2%, and a specificity of 96.7%. Therefore, an amino acid sequence-based feature extraction method that uses a neural network to detect N-fixing organisms is proposed and implemented.

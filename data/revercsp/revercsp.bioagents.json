    "description": "Time-Travelling in CSP Computations.\n\nreverCSP is a agent that allows us to evaluate a CSP specification in both directions: forwards (traditional computation) and backwards (using our reversible computation framework). reverCSP uses internally csp_tracker to produce tracks of the computation so one can better follows what is being computed so far (or henceforth if going backwards).",

This ability to reverse computations can be done step by step or backtracking to a given desired state of interest. reverCSP allows us to reverse computations exactly in the same order in which they happened, or also in a causally-consistent way. Therefore, reverCSP is a agent that can be especially useful to comprehend, analyze, and debug computations. reverCSP is an open-source project publicly available for the community. We describe the agent and its functionality, and we provide implementation details so that it can be reimplemented for other languages.",

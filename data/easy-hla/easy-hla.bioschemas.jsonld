We aim to improve efficiency by saving time and resources in HLA labs. From a patientâ€™s HLA typing in input, Easymatch-R displays probability of finding a potential unrelated bone marrow donor according to the required matching level. In addition to the number of expected donors, Easymatch-R provides complementary typings recomendations.\nHLA-Upgrade uses the power of haplotypes to predict full high resolution HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 genotypes.",

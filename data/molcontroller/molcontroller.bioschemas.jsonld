      "sc:description": "A VMD Graphical User Interface Featuring Molecule Manipulation.\n\nVisual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is one of the most widely used molecular graphics software in the community of theoretical simulations. So far, however, it still lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) for molecular manipulations when doing some modeling tasks. For instance, translation or rotation of a selected molecule(s) or part(s) of a molecule, which are currently only can be achieved using tcl scripts. Here, we use tcl script develop a user-friendly GUI for VMD, named Molcontroller, which is featured by allowing users to quickly and conveniently perform various molecular manipulations. This GUI might be helpful for improving the modeling efficiency of VMD users.",

Recently, spatial omics have enabled spatial tumor profiling, however computational resources that exploit the measurements to quantify tumor heterogeneity in a spatially aware manner are largely missing. We present ATHENA (Analysis of Tumor HEterogeNeity from spAtial omics measurements), a computational framework that facilitates the visualization, processing and analysis of tumor heterogeneity from spatial omics measurements. ATHENA uses graph representations of tumors and bundles together a large collection of established and novel heterogeneity scores that quantify different aspects of the complexity of tumor ecosystems.",

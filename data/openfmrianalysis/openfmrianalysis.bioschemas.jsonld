The wrappers should be seen as a consistent MATLAB command line interface to these functions, not as a reimplementation. A large part of these functions are written for my own convenience. A substantial part is new method development, mainly regarding laminar analysis.\n\nFrom this project root, run tvm_installLaminarAnalysisAgentbox.m in MATLAB.",

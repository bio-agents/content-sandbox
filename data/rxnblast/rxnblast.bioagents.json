Results: Here, we present RxnBLAST as a web-based agent for analyzing scaffold transformations and reactive chemical environment features in bioreactions. RxnBLAST extracts chemical features from bioreactions including atom-atom mapping, reaction centers, rules and functional groups to help understand chemical compositions and reaction patterns.

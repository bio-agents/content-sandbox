It is implemented in python 3 and relies on the Snakemake workflow management system. SEPATH was produced specifically to provide researchers with the ability to conduct ultra high throughput metagenomic studies from raw data to classification and has been benchmarked on simulated human cancer whole genome sequence datasets",

description: A set of wrappers for individual components of the sc3 package. functions
  r packages are hard to call when building workflows outside of r, so this package
  adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing. intermediate steps are
  currently mainly serialized r objects, but the ultimate objective is to have language-agnostic
  intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using a variety of software packages.

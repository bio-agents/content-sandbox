      "sc:description": "A manually curated database of the relations between membraneless organelles and diseases.\n\nMembraneless organelles (MLOs) play important roles in the temporal and spatial regulation of various biological processes, and emerging evidence supports that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is underlying the assembly of MLOs. Dysfunction of MLOs and LLPS are associated with various pathological processes.\n\nMloDisDB aims to gather MLOs and LLPS related diseases from the dispersed literature. Each entry was assigned with one of the three evidence levels based on original publication: Direct experiment, Indirect experiment, Clinical Investigation. The functional factors, changes of MLOs and changes of the factors were recorded, the components of MLOs and LLPS related predictions were integrated (go to About for detail).",

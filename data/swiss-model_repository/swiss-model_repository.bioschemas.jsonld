      "sc:description": "The SWISS-MODEL Repository is a database of annotated 3D protein structure models generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline. The aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up-to-date collection of annotated 3D protein models generated by automated homology modelling for relevant model organisms and experimental structure information for all sequences in UniProtKB. Regular updates ensure that target coverage is complete, that models are built using the most recent sequence and template structure databases, and that improvements in the underlying modelling pipeline are fully utilised. It also allows users to assess the quality of the models using the latest QMEAN results. If a sequence has not been modelled, the user can build models interactively via the SWISS-MODEL workspace.",

      "sc:description": "Effects of technical noise on bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression inference.\n\nAbstract Motivation Inconsistent, analytical noise introduced either by the sequencing technology or by the choice of read-processing agents can bias bulk RNA-seq analyses by shifting the focus to the variation in expression of low-abundance transcripts; as a consequence these highly-variable genes are often included the differential expression (DE) call and impact the interpretation of results. Results To illustrate the effects of “noise”, we present simulated datasets following closely the characteristics of a H.sapiens and a M.musculus dataset, respectively, highlighting the extent of technical-noise in both a high inter-individual variability ( H. sapiens ) and reduced variability ( M. Musculus ) setup.",

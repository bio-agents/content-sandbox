The simplest way to use iScore is through dedicated binaries that hide the complexity of the approach and allows access to the code with simple command line interfaces. The two binaries are iscore.train and iscore.predict that respectively train a model using a trainging set and use this model to predict the near-native character of unkown conformations.\n\nFree document hosting provided by Read the Docs",

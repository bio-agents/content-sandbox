  description: agentkit for nanopore nucleotide sequencing data
  long_description: " poreagents is a flexible agentkit for exploring datasets generated\
    \ by nanopore\n sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of quality control\
    \ and\n downstream analysis. Poreagents operates directly on the native FAST5 (a\n\
    \ variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a\n wealth\
    \ of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization\n agents.\n"

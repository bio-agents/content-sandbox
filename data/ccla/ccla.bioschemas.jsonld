      "sc:description": "an accurate method and web server for cancer cell line authentication using gene expression profiles.\n\nAbstract Cancer cell lines (CCLs) as important model systems play critical roles in cancer researches. The misidentification and contamination of CCLs are serious problems, leading to unreliable results and waste of resources. Current methods for CCL authentication are mainly based on the CCL-specific genetic polymorphisms, whereas no method is available for CCL authentication using gene expression profiles. Here, we developed a novel method and homonymic web server (CCLA, Cancer Cell Line Authentication, http: bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn web CCLA ) to authenticate 1,291 human CCLs of 28 tissues using gene expression profiles. CCLA curated CCL-specific gene signatures and employed machine learning methods to measure overall similarities and distances between the query sample and each reference CCL",

      "sc:description": "Fast and Accurate RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Deep Learning.\n\nAbstract For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correction function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy minimization. Here we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data without any thermodynamic assumptions",

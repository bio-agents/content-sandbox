  "sc:description": "Domprint is a domain-domain interaction (DDI) prediction server. It runs on a support vector machine (SVM) model which has been trained on known domain-domain interaction data (positive dataset) from 3did database. All the DDI in 3did are curated from crystal structures available in Protein Data Bank (PDB). We used a highly curated negative dataset for model training.",

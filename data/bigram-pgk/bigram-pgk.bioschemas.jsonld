The algorithm runs on the train and test data to obtain the values.\n\nPreprocessing_BigramPGK.m file was used to carry out preprocessing for Bigram_PGK predictor, which includes feature extraction for segment size of Â±32, filtering, and construction of train and test sets for 10-fold cross-validation. Everytime the algorithm is executed, it will have a slightly different combination of samples for train and test sets. Nevertheless, the performance will be similar",

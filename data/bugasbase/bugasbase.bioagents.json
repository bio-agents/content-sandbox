The data is mostly derived from whole genome microarrays designed by the BµG@S group, however data from other microarrays is included and the database is being modified to support RNA-Seq analysis. Public access is available for datasets that have been published and login credentials can be obtained for data submission.",

                "abstract": "The reducing cost of high-throughput functional genomic technologies is creating a deluge of high volume, complex data, placing the burden on bio-informatics resources and agent development. The Bacterial Microarray Group at St George's (BμG@S) has been at the forefront of bacterial microarray design and analysis for over a decade and while serving as a hub of a global network of microbial research groups has developed BμG@Sbase, a microbial gene expression and comparative genomic database. BμG@Sbase (http://bugs.sgul.ac.uk/ bugsbase/) is a web-browsable, expertly curated, MIAME-compliant database that stores comprehensive experimental annotation and multiple raw and analysed data formats. Consistent annotation is enabled through a structured set of web forms, which guide the user through the process following a set of best practices and controlled vocabulary. The database currently contains 86 expertly curated publicly available data sets (with a further 124 not yet published) and full annotation information for 59 bacterial microarray designs. The data can be browsed and queried using an explorer-like interface; integrating intuitive tree diagrams to present complex experimental details clearly and concisely. Furthermore the modular design of the database will provide a robust platform for integrating other data types beyond microarrays into a more Systems analysis based future. © The Author(s) 2011.",

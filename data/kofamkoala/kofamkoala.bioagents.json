    "description": "KEGG ortholog assignment based on profile HMM and adaptive score threshold.\n\nKofamKOALA - KEGG Orthology Search.\n\nK number assignment based on KO-dependent scoring criteria.\n\nKofamKOALA assigns K numbers to the user's sequence data by HMMER/HMMSEARCH against KOfam (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs (KOs)). K number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments. Such high score assignments are highlighted with asterisks '*' in the output. The K number assignments facilitate the interpretation of the annotation results by linking the user's sequence data to the KEGG pathways and EC numbers.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: KofamKOALA is a web server to assign KEGG Orthologs (KOs) to protein sequences by homology search against a database of profile hidden Markov models (KOfam) with pre-computed adaptive score thresholds. KofamKOALA is faster than existing KO assignment agents with its accuracy being comparable to the best performing agents. Function annotation by KofamKOALA helps linking genes to KEGG resources such as the KEGG pathway maps and facilitates molecular network reconstruction.",

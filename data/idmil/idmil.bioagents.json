Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism. Results: The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.",

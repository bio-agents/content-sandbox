                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the proteins are very important parameters that control their subcellular localization and subsequent function. Although the genome sequence data of the plant kingdom improved enormously, the proteomic details have been poorly elaborated. Therefore, we have calculated the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the plant proteins and reported them in this database. A database, PlantMWpIDB, containing protein data from 342 plant proteomes was created to provide information on plant proteomes for hypothesis formulation in basic research and for biotechnological applications. The Molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) are important molecular parameters of proteins that are useful when conducting protein studies involving 2D gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and X-ray protein crystallography. PlantMWpIDB provides an easy-to-use and efficient interface for search options and generates a summary of basic protein parameters. The database represents a virtual 2D proteome map of plants, and the molecular weight and pI of a protein can be obtained by searching on the name of a protein, a keyword, or by a list of accession numbers. The PlantMWpIDB database also allows one to query protein sequences. The database can be found in the following link https://plantmwpidb.com/. The individual 2D virtual proteome map of the plant kingdom will enable us to understand the proteome diversity between different species. Further, the molecular weight and isoelectric point of individual proteins can enable us to understand their functional significance in different species.",

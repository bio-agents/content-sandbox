                "abstract": "© 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.iRefWeb is a resource that provides web interface to a large collection of protein–protein interactions aggregated from major primary databases. The underlying data-consolidation process, called iRefIndex, implements a rigorous methodology of identifying redundant protein sequences and integrating disparate data records that reference the same peptide sequences, despite many potential differences in data identifiers across various source databases. iRefWeb offers a unified user interface to all interaction records and associated information collected by iRefIndex, in addition to a number of data filters and visual features that present the supporting evidence. Users of iRefWeb can explore the consolidated landscape of protein–protein interactions, establish the provenance and reliability of each data record, and compare annotations performed by different data curator teams. The iRefWeb portal is freely available at http://wodaklab.org/iRefWeb.",

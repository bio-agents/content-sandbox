      "sc:description": "ChemStor is an open-source, automated computational system that can guarantee (mathematically verify a system is correct with respect to its specification), with regard to prescribed constraints, safe storage and disposal of chemicals used in academic, industrial, and domestic settings. ChemStor borrows concepts from formal methods - a branch of computer science capable of mathematically proving a specification or software is correct - to safely store or dispose of chemicals. If two or more chemicals can be combined in the same cabinet without forming possibly dangerous combinations of chemicals (while observing cabinet/shelf space constraints), then ChemStor determines that the storage configuration is safe.",

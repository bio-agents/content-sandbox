Identification of potential disease-causal variants is labor intensive as it relies on filtering using various annotation metrics and consideration of multiple pathogenicity prediction scores. We have developed VPOT (variant prioritization ordering agent), a python-based command line agent that allows researchers to create a single fully customizable pathogenicity ranking score from any number of annotation values, each with a user-defined weighting. The use of VPOT can be informative when analyzing entire cohorts, as variants in a cohort can be prioritized. VPOT also provides additional functions to allow variant filtering based on a candidate gene list or by affected status in a family pedigree. VPOT outperforms similar agents in terms of efficacy, flexibility, scalability, and computational performance. VPOT is freely available for public use at GitHub (https://github.com/VCCRI/VPOT/). Documentation for installation along with a user tutorial, a default parameter file, and test data are provided.",

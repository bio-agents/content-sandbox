      "sc:description": "Iintegrated Ethiopian traditional herbal medicine and phytochemicals database | ETM-DB is a free, online relational database containing Ethiopian herbal medicine, related compounds and target gene/proteins. Ethiopia is endowed with an affluence of botanical remedies that have proven useful over a long time, especially in the rural areas where modern health care is much less accessible. It is estimated that about 80% of the Ethiopian population, predominantly in the rural areas, use traditional medicine. There are about 6,500-7,500 plant species in Ethiopia, of which an estimated 12% are endemic to Ethiopia",

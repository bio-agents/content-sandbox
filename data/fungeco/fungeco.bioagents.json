    "description": "A web based agent for estimation of Functional potential of bacterial genomes and microbiomes using Gene Context information.\n\nFunctional potential of bacterial genomes and microbiomes from gene context information.\n\nThis feature allows the user to input a newly sequenced genome and annotate it using gene context based modules generated using extensive literature mining and manual curation. Users can also carry out comparative analysis (synteny view using parallel coordinates) of the uploaded genome with genomes already sequenced in NCBI using interactive visualizations.\n\nThis feature allows comparison of functional modules in sequenced genomes obtained from NCBI. Users can interactively select upto five genomes which are compared using a synteny based visualization (parallel coordinates) and circular genomic representations. Information about individual modules in all these genomes can also be viewed as tabular outputs",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Functional potential of genomes and metagenomes which are inferred using homology-based methods are often subjected to certain limitations, especially for proteins with homologs which function in multiple pathways. Augmenting the homology information with genomic location of the constituent genes can significantly improve the accuracy of estimated functions. This can help in distinguishing cognate homolog belonging to a candidate pathway from its other homologs functional in different pathways. Results: In this article, we present a web-based analysis platform 'FunGeCo' to enable gene-context-based functional inference for microbial genomes and metagenomes. It is expected to be a valuable resource and complement the existing agents for understanding the functional potential of microbes which reside in an environment.",

These compounds are attributed with variety of nutritional as well as therapeutic value. Flavonoids are often known for their effective antioxidant nature; however, their various other bioactivities are well established. These bioactivities mainly includes antibacterial, anti-cancer, cardio protective, promotion of immune system, anti-inflammatory and skin protection from ultra violet radiation; these properties are effectively reviewed by Tungmunnithum et al 2018.",

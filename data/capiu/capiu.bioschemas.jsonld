  "sc:description": "Novel approach for clustering samples (treatments, patients, condition etc) by using annotational information about the genes. The algorithm searches all pre-defined gene classes for classes that exhibit a strong clustering of the samples. These are then used to split the samples in two groups until no significant splits can be found. The result is visualized as a tree with gene classes as nodes and groups of samples as leaves.",

                "abstract": "Haplotype inference has relevant biological applications, and represents a challenging computational problem. Among others, pure parsimony provides a viable modeling approach for haplotype inference and provides a simple optimization criterion. Alternative approaches have been proposed for haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP), including branch and bound, integer programming and, more recently, propositional satisfiability and pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO). Among these, the currently best performing HIPP approach is based on PBO. This paper proposes a number of effective improvements to PBO-based HIPP, including the use of lower bounding and pruning techniques effective with other approaches. The new PBO-based HIPP approach reduces by 50% the number of instances that remain unsolvable by HIPP based approaches. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

                "abstract": "Haplotype inference from genotype data is a key computational problem in bioinformatics, since retrieving directly haplotype information from DNA samples is not feasible using existing technology. One of the methods for solving this problem uses the pure parsimony criterion, an approach known as Haplotype Inference by Pure Parsimony (HIPP). Initial work in this area was based on a number of different Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models and branch and bound algorithms. Recent work has shown that the utilization of a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulation and state of the art SAT solvers represents the most efficient approach for solving the HIPP problem. Motivated by the promising results obtained using SAT techniques, this paper investigates the utilization of modern Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) algorithms for solving the HIPP problem. The paper starts by applying PBO to existing ILP models. The results are promising, and motivate the development of a new PBO model (RPoly) for the HIPP problem, which has a compact representation and eliminates key symmetries. Experimental results indicate that RPoly outperforms the SAT-based approach on most problem instances, being, in general, significantly more efficient. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",

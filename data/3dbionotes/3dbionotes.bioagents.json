Structural information is also rapidly growing, especially in the cryo Electron Microscopy area. However, in many cases, the proteomic and genomic data are spread in multiple databases and with no simple connection to structural information.In this work we present a new web platform that integrates EMDB/PDB structures and UniProt sequences with different sources of protein annotations. The application provides an interactive interface linking sequence and structure, including EM maps, presenting the different sources of information at sequence and structural level.

Therefore, analysing genomic variants with structural and molecular biology data is a powerful framework in order to elucidate the potential causes of such diseases. Results: A new version of our web framework 3DBIONOTES is presented. This version offers new agents to analyse and visualize protein annotations and genomic variants, including a contingency analysis of variants and amino acid features by means of a Fisher exact test, the integration of a gene annotation viewer to highlight protein features on gene sequences and a protein-protein interaction viewer to display protein annotations at network level.

      "sc:description": "Elucidating the mechanism of drugs and diseases using gene expression and transcriptional regulatory networks.\n\nDeltaNeTS+ is a major improvement to our previous method DeltaNet. DeltaNeTS+ is a method for inferring direct gene targets of drug compounds and diseases from steady-state and/or time-series transcriptional profiles. DeltaNeTS+ incorporates gene regulatory information (if avaialbe) during the inference. DeltaNeTS+ generates a perturbation score for each gene in every sample. The score magnitude reflects the confidence that the transcription process of this gene was directly affected by the external stimuli. The score sign indicates the nature of the perturbation: positive for gene induction, negative for gene repression",

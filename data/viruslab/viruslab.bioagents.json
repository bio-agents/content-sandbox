                "abstract": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to viral data analysis and connected host disease diagnostic methods. We propose VirusLab, a flexible system for analysing SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and relating them to metadata or clinical information about the host. VirusLab capitalizes on two existing resources: ViruSurf, a database of public SARS-CoV-2 sequences supporting metadata-driven search, and VirusViz, a agent for visual analysis of search results. VirusLab is designed for taking advantage of these resources within a server-side architecture that: (i) covers pipelines based on approaches already in use (ARTIC, Galaxy) but entirely cutomizable upon user request; (ii) predigests analysis of raw sequencing data from different platforms (Oxford Nanopore and Illumina); (iii) gives access to public archives datasets; (iv) supplies user-friendly reporting – making it a agent that can also be integrated into a business environment. VirusLab can be installed and hosted within the premises of any organization where information about SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be safely integrated with information about hosts (e.g., clinical metadata). A system such as VirusLab is not currently available in the landscape of similar providers: our results show that VirusLab is a powerful agent to generate tabular/graphical and machine readable reports that can be integrated in more complex pipelines. We foresee that the proposed system can support many research-oriented and therapeutic scenarios within hospitals or the tracing of viral sequences and their mutational processes within organizations for viral surveillance.",

      "sc:description": "Advancing Divide-and-Conquer Phylogeny Estimation using Robinson-Foulds Supertrees.\n\nGreedyRFS is a heuristic method developed for the Robinson-Foulds Supertree problem. It takes a set of binary source trees which have overlapping leaf sets as input and outputs a binary supertree on the union of leaves. This heuristic relies on an exact algorithm for the Robinson-Foulds Supertree problem on two source trees. It repeatedly chooses two trees from the source trees (according to some greedy criterion) and merges them using the exact algorithm until only one supertree remains. (A paper detailing the algorithm and experimental results is submitted to SODA and will be available in the future.).",

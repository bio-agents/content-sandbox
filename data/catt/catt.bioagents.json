For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.comMotivation: T-cell receptors (TCRs) function to recognize antigens and play vital roles in T-cell immunology. Surveying TCR repertoires by characterizing complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) is a key issue. Due to the high diversity of CDR3 and technological limitation, accurate characterization of CDR3 repertoires remains a great challenge. Results: We propose a computational method named CATT for ultra-sensitive and precise TCR CDR3 sequences detection. CATT can be applied on TCR sequencing, RNA-Seq and single-cell TCR(RNA)-Seq data to characterize CDR3 repertoires. CATT integrated de Bruijn graph-based micro-assembly algorithm, data-driven error correction model and Bayesian inference algorithm, to self-adaptively and ultra-sensitively characterize CDR3 repertoires with high performance. Benchmark results of datasets from in silico and experimental data demonstrated that CATT showed superior recall and precision compared with existing agents, especially for data with short read length and small size and single-cell sequencing data. Thus, CATT will be a useful agent for TCR analysis in researches of cancer and immunology.

      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.agents/smog | A Lightweight Agent for Object-Spreadsheet Mapping | In the life science domain, experts are usually familiar with spreadsheet software and often use it in their daily work to collect and structure required domain knowledge. The processing and analysis of spreadsheet data is an important task that must be supported by efficient software solutions. A typical application scenario is for example an integration of spreadsheet data (specified or derived) in an ontology to provide reasoning or search. Different converter agents were developed to support a spreadsheet-to-ontology transformation. Such agents allow often only a relatively simple structure of the spreadsheet template or they require complex mapping processes to map the spreadsheet and ontological entities",

      "sc:description": "a database of gene co-expression network for tea plant (Camellia sinensis).\n\nTea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the worldâ€™s most important beverage crops with essential economic and health benefits. However, the functional exploration of tea genes related to important agronomic traits, such as secondary metabolism, leaf yield, and stress resistance, is now significantly lagging, which puts an obstacle for applied genetic improvement and molecular breeding in tea plant. Here, a database of gene co-expression network for tea plant (TeaCoN) was developed to serve as a solid platform for candidate gene screening and functional exploration of important agronomical traits in tea plant.",

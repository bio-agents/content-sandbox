      "sc:description": "artificial intelligence approach to quantify co-localization between mass spectrometry images | Methods for measuring co-localization of ion images | Measuring co-localization of ion images | This repository is devoted to a project on measuring co-localization of mass spectrometry images. The project is carried out by the Alexandrov team at EMBL Heidelberg. We created a webapp for ranking pairs of ion images, engaged external experts to rank images from their public data from METASPACE, consolidated the results into a gold standard set of ranked pairs of ion images, and, finally, developed and evaluated various measures of co-localization | Katja Ovchinnikova: pixel-based co-localization method development, gold standard preparation",

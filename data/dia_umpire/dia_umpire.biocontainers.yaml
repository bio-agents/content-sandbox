description: DIA-Umpire is an open source Java program for computational analysis
  of data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. It
  enables untargeted peptide and protein identification and quantitation using DIA
  data, and also incorporates targeted extraction to reduce the number of cases of
  missing quantitation.

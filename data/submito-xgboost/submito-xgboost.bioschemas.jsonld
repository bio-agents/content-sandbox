They not only play an important role in energy metabolism but also take part in many critical cytopathological processes. Abnormal mitochondria can trigger a series of human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multifactor disorder, and Type-II diabetes. Protein submitochondrial localization enables the understanding of protein function in studying disease pathogenesis and drug design. RESULTS:We proposed a new method, SubMito-XGBoost, for protein submitochondrial localization prediction",

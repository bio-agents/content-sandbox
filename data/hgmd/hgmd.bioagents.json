Data catalogued includes: single base-pair substitutions in coding, regulatory and splicing-relevant regions; micro-deletions and micro-insertions; indels; triplet repeat expansions as well as gross deletions; insertions; duplications; and complex rearrangements. Each mutation is entered into HGMD only once in order to avoid confusion between recurrent and identical-by-descent lesions. By March 2003, the database contained in excess of 39,415 different lesions detected in 1,516 different nuclear genes, with new entries currently accumulating at a rate exceeding 5,000 per annum. Since its inception, HGMD has been expanded to include cDNA reference sequences for more than 87% of listed genes, splice junction sequences, disease-associated and functional polymorphisms, as well as links to data present in publicly available online locus-specific mutation databases. Although HGMD has recently entered into a licensing agreement with Celera Genomics (Rockville, MD), mutation data will continue to be made freely available via the Internet. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In the present study, 520 179 GTs from approximately 21 647 species that involved in 394 kinds of different reactions were deposited in GTDB. GTDB has the following useful features: (i) text search is provided for retrieving the complete details of a query by combining multiple identifiers and data sources; (ii) a convenient browser allows users to browse data by different classifications and download data in batches; (iii) BLAST is offered for searching against pre-defined sequences, which can facilitate the annotation of the biological functions of query GTs; and lastly, (iv) GTdock using AutoDock Vina performs docking simulations of several GTs with the same single acceptor and displays the results based on 3Dmol.js allowing easy view of models.",

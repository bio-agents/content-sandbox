      "sc:description": "an integrated resource for glycosyltransferase sequences and annotations.\n\nGlycosyltransferases (GTs), a large class of carbohydrate-active enzymes, adds glycosyl moieties to various substrates to generate multiple bioactive compounds, including natural products with pharmaceutical or agrochemical values. Here, we first collected comprehensive information on GTs, including amino acid sequences, coding region sequences, available tertiary structures, protein classification families, catalytic reactions and metabolic pathways. Then, we developed sequence search and molecular docking processes for GTs, resulting in a GTs database (GTDB). In the present study, 520 179 GTs from approximately 21 647 species that involved in 394 kinds of different reactions were deposited in GTDB",

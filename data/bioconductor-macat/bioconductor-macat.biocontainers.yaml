description: This library contains functions to investigate links between differential
  gene expression and the chromosomal localization of the genes. it implements an
  statistical approach for identifying significantly differentially expressed chromosome
  regions. the functions have been tested on a publicly available data set about acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia.

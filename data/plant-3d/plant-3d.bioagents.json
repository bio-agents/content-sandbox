    "description": "Plant 3D is a plant phenotyping agentkit for 3D point clouds.\n\nPlant 3D (P3D) automatically extracts common phenotyping features of interest from high-resolution 3D scans of plant architectures. P3D is open-source and is bundled with a stand-alone Windows application. P3D is written in C++ using OpenGL, QT, TensorFlow, and the point cloud library (PCL). P3D can visualize and process data imported as a 3D point cloud (pcd or txt formats) or a mesh (obj format).",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Developing methods to efficiently analyze 3D point cloud data of plant architectures remain challenging for many phenotyping applications. Here, we describe a agent that tackles four core phenotyping tasks: classification of cloud points into stem and lamina points, graph skeletonization of the stem points, segmentation of individual lamina and whole leaf labeling. These four tasks are critical for numerous downstream phenotyping goals, such as quantifying plant biomass, performing morphological analyses of plant shapes and uncovering genotype to phenotype relationships. The Plant 3D agent provides an intuitive graphical user interface, a fast 3D rendering engine for visualizing plants with millions of cloud points, and several graph-theoretic and machine-learning algorithms for 3D architecture analyses.

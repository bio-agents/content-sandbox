      "sc:description": "A curated transcriptome dataset collection to investigate inborn errors of immunity.\n\nPrimary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders, frequently caused by loss-of-function and less commonly by gain-of-function mutations, which can result in susceptibility to a broad or a very narrow range of infections but also in inflammatory, allergic or malignant diseases. Owing to the wide range in clinical manifestations and variability in penetrance and expressivity, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying molecular, cellular and immunological phenotypes in PID patients in order to improve clinical diagnosis and management. Here we have compiled a manually curated collection of public transcriptome datasets mainly obtained from human whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or fibroblasts of patients with PIDs and of control subjects for subsequent meta-analysis, query and interpretation",

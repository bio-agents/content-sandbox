    "description": "Single-sample quantification of RNA, proteins and metabolites for biomolecular network analysis | In Vitro Transcription NMR. Protocol, code and examples for the co-transcriptional RNA folding network reconstruction | The protocol describes how to setup and analyse observation of a co-transcriptional RNA folding network by Systems NMR approach. While most experimental approaches can monitor only a single molecule class or reaction type at a time, Systems NMR permits single-sample dynamic quantification of entire “heterotypic” networks – involving different reaction and molecule types. It thus provides a deeper systems-level understanding of biological network dynamics by combining the dynamic resolution of biochemical assays and the multiplexing ability of “omics”",

Most experimental methods, however, can only monitor a single molecule class or reaction type at a time. We developed an in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) approach, which permitted dynamic quantification of an entire ‘heterotypic’ network—simultaneously monitoring three distinct molecule classes (metabolites, proteins and RNA) and all elementary reaction types (bimolecular interactions, catalysis, unimolecular changes). Focusing on an eight-reaction co-transcriptional RNA folding network, in a single sample we recorded over 35 time points with over 170 observables each, and accurately determined five core reaction constants in multiplex. This reconstruction revealed unexpected cross-talk between the different reactions. We further observed dynamic phase-separation in a system of five distinct RNA-binding domains in the course of the RNA transcription reaction. Our Systems NMR approach provides a deeper understanding of biological network dynamics by combining the dynamic resolution of biochemical assays and the multiplexing ability of ‘omics’.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The Author(s)In the last three decades, the multi-subunit Mediator complex has emerged as the key component of transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Although there were initial hiccups, recent advancements in bioinformatics agents contributed significantly to in-silico prediction and characterization of Mediator subunits from several organisms belonging to different eukaryotic kingdoms. In this study, we have developed the first database of Mediator proteins named MedProDB with 33,971 Mediator protein entries. Out of those, 12531, 11545, and 9895 sequences belong to metazoans, plants, and fungi, respectively. Apart from the core information consisting of sequence, length, position, organism, molecular weight, and taxonomic lineage, additional information of each Mediator sequence like aromaticity, hydropathy, instability index, isoelectric point, functions, interactions, repeat regions, diseases, sequence alignment to Mediator subunit family, Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs), Post-translation modifications (PTMs), and Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) may be of high utility to the users. Furthermore, different types of search and browse options with four different agents namely BLAST, Smith-Waterman Align, IUPred, and MoRF-Chibi_Light are provided at MedProDB to perform different types of analysis. Being a critical component of the transcriptional machinery and regulating almost all the aspects of transcription, it generated lots of interest in structural and functional studies of Mediator functioning. So, we think that the MedProDB database will be very useful for researchers studying the process of transcription. This database is freely available at www.nipgr.ac.in/MedProDB.",

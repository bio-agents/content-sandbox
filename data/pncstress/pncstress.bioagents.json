Accumulating evidence indicates that ncRNA-related mechanisms play important roles in plant stress responses. Although abundant plant stress-responsive ncRNAs have been identified, these experimentally validated results have not been gathered into a single public domain archive. Therefore, we established PncStress by curating experimentally validated stress-responsive ncRNAs in plants, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. The current version of PncStress contains 4227 entries from 114 plants covering 48 biotic and 91 abiotic stresses. For each entry, PncStress has biological information and network visualization. Serving as a manually curated database, PncStress will become a valuable resource in support of plant stress response research.",

    "description": "a agent for detection, annotation and relative quantification of alternative junctions from RNAseq data.\n\nRNAseq pipeline for alternative splicing junctions.\n\nSpliceLauncher is a pipeline agent to study the alternative splicing. It works in three steps:.\n\nSpliceLauncher comes with a ready to use config.cfg file. It contains the paths of software and files used by SpliceLauncher. The INSTALL mode of SpliceLauncher updates this config.cfg file. If you define the path to GFF (v3) file and path to the FASTA genome, the INSTALL mode will extract all necessary information from this GFF and indexing the STAR genome. This informations are stored in a BED file that contains the exon coordinates, in a sjdb file that contains the intron coordinates and a text file that contains the details of transcript structures. You need to define where these files will saving by the -O, --output argument",

Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: Alternative splicing is an important biological process widely analyzed in molecular diagnostic settings. Indeed, a variant can be pathogenic by splicing alteration and a suspected pathogenic variant (e.g. truncating variant) can be rescued by splicing. In this context, detecting and quantifying alternative splicing is challenging. We developed SpliceLauncher, a fast and easy to use open source agent that aims at detecting, annotating and quantifying alternative splice junctions at high resolution.",

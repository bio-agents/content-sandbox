A part of the data is available at the Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp; https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp) as a web-based database, as reported in our previous manuscript published in Nucleic Acid Research in 2018. At that time, jMorp mainly consisted of metabolome data; however, now genome, methylome, and transcriptome data have been integrated in addition to the enhancement of the number of samples for the metabolome data. For genomic data, jMorp provides a Japanese reference sequence obtained using de novo assembly of sequences from three Japanese individuals and allele frequencies obtained using whole-genome sequencing of 8,380 Japanese individuals. In addition, the omics data include methylome and transcriptome data from ∼300 samples and distribution of concentrations of more than 755 metabolites obtained using high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance and high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. In summary, jMorp now provides four different kinds of omics data (genome, methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome), with a user-friendly web interface. This will be a useful scientific data resource on the general population for the discovery of disease biomarkers and personalized disease prevention and early diagnosis.",

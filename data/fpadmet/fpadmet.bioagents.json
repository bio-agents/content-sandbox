In silico approaches based on machine learning methods are becoming increasing popular, but are nonetheless limited by the availability of data. With a view to making both data and models available to the scientific community, we have developed FPADMET which is a repository of molecular fingerprint-based predictive models for ADMET properties. Summary: In this article, we have examined the efficacy of fingerprint-based machine learning models for a large number of ADMET-related properties. The predictive ability of a set of 20 different binary fingerprints (based on substructure keys, atom pairs, local path environments, as well as custom fingerprints such as all-shortest paths) for over 50 ADMET and ADMET-related endpoints have been evaluated as part of the study. We find that for a majority of the properties, fingerprint-based random forest models yield comparable or better performance compared with traditional 2D/3D molecular descriptors. Availability: The models are made available as part of open access software that can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/vishsoft/fpadmet.",

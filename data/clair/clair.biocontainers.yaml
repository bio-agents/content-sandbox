description: Single-molecule sequencing technologies have emerged in recent years
  and revolutionized structural variant calling, complex genome assembly, and epigenetic
  mark detection. however, the lack of a highly accurate small variant caller has
  limited the new technologies from being more widely used. in this study, we present
  clair, the successor to clairvoyante, a program for fast and accurate germline small
  variant calling, using single molecule sequencing data. for ont data, clair achieves
  the best precision, recall and speed as compared to several competing programs,
  including clairvoyante, longshot and medaka. through studying the missed variants
  and benchmarking intentionally overfitted models, we found that clair may be approaching
  the limit of possible accuracy for germline small variant calling using pileup data
  and deep neural networks.

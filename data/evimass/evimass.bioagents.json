                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2019 Srivastava, Baksi, Kuntal and Mande.The importance of understanding microbe–microbe as well as microbe–disease associations is one of the key thrust areas in human microbiome research. High-throughput metagenomic and transcriptomic projects have fueled discovery of a number of new microbial associations. Consequently, a plethora of information is being added routinely to biomedical literature, thereby contributing toward enhancing our knowledge on microbial associations. In this communication, we present a agent called “EviMass” (Evidence based mining of human Microbial Associations), which can assist biologists to validate their predicted hypotheses from new microbiome studies. Users can interactively query the processed back-end database for microbe–microbe and disease–microbe associations. The EviMass agent can also be used to upload microbial association networks generated from a human “disease–control” microbiome study and validate the associations from biomedical literature. Additionally, a list of differentially abundant microbes for the corresponding disease can be queried in the agent for reported evidences. The results are presented as graphical plots, tabulated summary, and other evidence statistics. EviMass is a comprehensive platform and is expected to enable microbiome researchers not only in mining microbial associations, but also enriching a new research hypothesis. The agent is available free for academic use at https://web.rniapps.net/evimass.",

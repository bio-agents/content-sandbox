Currently, there are only a few prediction servers available, though discontinuous epitopes constitute the majority of all B-cell antigenic epitopes. In this chapter, we describe two online servers, EPCES and EPSVR, for discontinuous epitope prediction. All methods were benchmarked by a curated independent test set, in which all antigens had no complex structures with the antibody, and their epitopes were identified by various biochemical experiments. The servers and all datasets are available at http://sysbio.unl.edu/EPCES/ and http://sysbio.unl.edu/EPSVR/.",

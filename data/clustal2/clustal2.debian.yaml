description: This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence
  alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing multiple
  sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results. The sequence alignment
  is displayed in a window on the screen. A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated
  to highlight conserved features in the alignment. For professional presentations,
  one should use the texshade LaTeX package or boxshade. . The pull-down menus at
  the top of the window allow you to select all the options required for traditional
  multiple sequence and profile alignment. You can cut-and-paste sequences to change
  the order of the alignment; you can select a subset of sequences to be aligned;
  you can select a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into
  the original alignment. . An alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring
  segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted.

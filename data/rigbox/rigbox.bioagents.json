    "description": "An Open-Source Agentbox for Probing Neurons and Behavior.\n\nRigbox is a high-performance, open-source MATLAB agentbox for managing behavioral neuroscience experiments. Rigbox's main goals are to simplify hardware/software interfacing, behavioral task design, and visual and auditory stimuli presentation. Additionally, Rigbox can time-align datastreams from multiple sources and communicate with a remote database to manage experiment data. Rigbox is mostly object-oriented and highly modular, which simplifies the process of designing experiments. For detailed information, see the publication.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Bhagat et al.Setting up an experiment in behavioral neuroscience is a complex process that is often managed with ad hoc solutions. To streamline this process, we developed Rigbox, a high-performance, open-source software agentbox that facilitates a modular approach to designing experiments (https://github.com/cortex-lab/Rigbox). Rigbox simplifies hardware input-output, time aligns datastreams from multiple sources, communicates with remote databases, and implements visual and auditory stimuli presentation. Its main submodule, Signals, al-lows intuitive programming of behavioral tasks. Here we illustrate its function with the following two interactive examples: a human psychophysics experiment, and the game of Pong. We give an overview of running experiments in Rigbox, provide benchmarks, and conclude with a discussion on the extensibility of the software and comparisons with similar agentboxes. Rigbox runs in MATLAB, with Java components to handle network com-munication, and a C library to boost performance.",

Published by Oxford University Press.We previously released the Anti-CRISPRdb database hosting anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) and associated information. Since then, the number of known Acr families, types, structures and inhibitory activities has accumulated over time, and Acr neighbors can be used as a candidate pool for screening Acrs in further studies. Therefore, we here updated the database to include the new available information. Our newly updated database shows several improvements: (i) it comprises more entries and families because it includes both Acrs reported in the most recent literatures and Acrs obtained via performing homologous alignment; (ii) the prediction of Acr neighbors is integrated into Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2, and users can identify novel Acrs from these candidates; and (iii) this version includes experimental information on the inhibitory strength and stage for Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, motivating the development of agents for predicting specific inhibitory abilities. Additionally, a parameter, the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank), was proposed and provided in the new version, which showed a positive relationship with predicted result from AcRanker; hence, it can be used as an indicator for proteins to be Acrs. CUBRank can be used to estimate the possibility of genes occurring within genome island - a hotspot hosting potential genes encoding Acrs. Based on CUBRank and Anti-CRISPRdb, we also gave the first glimpse for the emergence of Acr genes (acrs). Database URL: http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb",

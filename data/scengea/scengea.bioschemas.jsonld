      "sc:description": "Expression profiling of the mature C. elegans nervous system by single-cell RNA-Sequencing | Abstract A single neuron and its synapses define the fundamental structural motif of the brain but the underlying gene expression programs that specify individual neuron types are poorly understood. To address this question in a model organism, we have produced a gene expression profile of >90% of the individual neuron classes in the C. elegans nervous system, an ensemble of neurons for which both the anatomy and connectivity are uniquely defined at single cell resolution. We generated single cell transcriptomes for 52,412 neurons that resolve as clusters corresponding to 109 of the canonical 118 neuron classes in the mature hermaphrodite nervous system. Detailed analysis revealed molecular signatures that further subdivide identified classes into specific neuronal subtypes",

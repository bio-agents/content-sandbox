      "sc:description": "Aided Decision-Making for the Study of Protein Complexes | Abstract Proteins are the chief effectors of cell biology and their functions are typically carried out in the context of multi-protein assemblies; large collections of such interacting protein assemblies are often referred to as interactomes. Knowing the constituents of protein complexes is therefore important for investigating their molecular biology. Many experimental methods are capable of producing data of use for detecting and inferring the existence of physiological protein complexes. Each method has associated pros and cons, affecting the potential quality and utility of the data. Numerous informatic resources exist for the curation, integration, retrieval, and processing of protein interactions data. While each resource may possess different merits, none are definitive and few are wieldy, potentially limiting their effective use by non-experts",

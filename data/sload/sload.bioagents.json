Published by Oxford University Press.Synthetic lethality has been widely concerned because of its potential role in cancer treatment, which can be harnessed to selectively kill cancer cells via identifying inactive genes in a specific cancer type and further targeting the corresponding synthetic lethal partners. Herein, to obtain cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions, we aimed to predict genetic interactions via a pan-cancer analysis from multiple molecular levels using random forest and then develop a user-friendly database. First, based on collected public gene pairs with synthetic lethal interactions, candidate gene pairs were analyzed via integrating multi-omics data, mainly including DNA mutation, copy number variation, methylation and mRNA expression data. Then, integrated features were used to predict cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions using random forest. Finally, SLOAD (http://www.tmliang.cn/SLOAD) was constructed via integrating these findings, which was a user-friendly database for data searching, browsing, downloading and analyzing. These results can provide candidate cancer-specific synthetic lethal interactions, which will contribute to drug designing in cancer treatment that can promote therapy strategies based on the principle of synthetic lethality.

There are two GUIs: manual version for fine-scale analyses, batch version for local files or from a list of URLs.",

Applications in Plant Sciences is published by Wiley Periodicals, LLC on behalf of the Botanical Society of AmericaPremise: Obtaining phenotypic data from herbarium specimens can provide important insights into plant evolution and ecology but requires significant manual effort and time. Here, we present LeafMachine, an application designed to autonomously measure leaves from digitized herbarium specimens or leaf images using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. Methods and Results: We trained LeafMachine on 2685 randomly sampled specimens from 138 herbaria and evaluated its performance on specimens spanning 20 diverse families and varying widely in resolution, quality, and layout. LeafMachine successfully extracted at least one leaf measurement from 82.0% and 60.8% of high- and low-resolution images, respectively. Of the unmeasured specimens, only 0.9% and 2.1% of high- and low-resolution images, respectively, were visually judged to have measurable leaves. Conclusions: This flexible autonomous agent has the potential to vastly increase available trait information from herbarium specimens, and inform a multitude of evolutionary and ecological studies.",

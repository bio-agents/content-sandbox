For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.The prediction of genes related to diseases is important to the study of the diseases due to high cost and time consumption of biological experiments. Network propagation is a popular strategy for disease-gene prediction. However, existing methods focus on the stable solution of dynamics while ignoring the useful information hidden in the dynamical process, and it is still a challenge to make use of multiple types of physical/functional relationships between proteins/genes to effectively predict disease-related genes. Therefore, we proposed a framework of network impulsive dynamics on multiplex biological network (NIDM) to predict disease-related genes, along with four variants of NIDM models and four kinds of impulsive dynamical signatures (IDSs). NIDM is to identify disease-related genes by mining the dynamical responses of nodes to impulsive signals being exerted at specific nodes. By a series of experimental evaluations in various types of biological networks, we confirmed the advantage of multiplex network and the important roles of functional associations in disease-gene prediction, demonstrated superior performance of NIDM compared with four types of network-based algorithms and then gave the effective recommendations of NIDM models and IDS signatures. To facilitate the prioritization and analysis of (candidate) genes associated to specific diseases, we developed a user-friendly web server, which provides three kinds of filtering patterns for genes, network visualization, enrichment analysis and a wealth of external links (http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/DGP/NID.jsp). NIDM is a protocol for disease-gene prediction integrating different types of biological networks, which may become a very useful computational agent for the study of disease-related genes.",

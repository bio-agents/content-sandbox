description: Ericscript is a computational framework for the discovery of gene fusions
  in paired end rna-seq data. it is able to generate synthetic gene fusions by using
  the ericscript simulator and calculate a number of statistical measures for evaluating
  gene fusion detection methods performance with ericscript calcstats.

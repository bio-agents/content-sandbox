      "sc:description": "SearcHPV detects HPV fusion sites on both human genome and HPV genome.\n\nSearcHPV is able to provide locally assembled contigs for each integration events. It will report at least one and at most two contigs for each integration sites. The two contigs will provide information captured for left and right sides of the event.\n\nSearcHPV is a novel approach to identify and assemble human papillomavirus-host genomic integration events in cancer.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.We present RegulomePA, a database that contains biological information on regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs), sigma factor (SFs) and target genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. RegulomePA consists of 4827 regulatory interactions between 2831 nodes, which represent the interactions of TFs and SFs with their target genes, from the total of predicted RegulomePA including 27.27% of the TFs, 54.16% of SFs and 50.8% of the total genes. Each entry in the database corresponds to one node in the network and provides comprehensive details about the gene and its regulatory interactions such as gene description, nucleotide sequence, genome-strand position and links to other databases as well as the type of regulation it exerts or to which it is being subject (repression or activation), the associated experimental evidence and references, and topological information. Additionally, RegulomePA provides a way to recover information on the regulatory circuits of the network to which a gene pertains and also makes available the source codes to analyze the topology of any other regulatory network. The database will be updated yearly, by our team, with the contributions from ourselves and users, since the users are provided with an interactive platform where they can add interactions to the regulatory network feeding it with their respective references.

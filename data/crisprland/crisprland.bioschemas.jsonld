      "sc:description": "CRISPRLand, relies on an unexploited observation about the nature of the repair process: the landscape of the DNA repair is highly sparse in the (Walshâ€“Hadamard) spectral domain. This observation enables our framework to address key shortcomings that limit the interpretability and scaling of current deep-learning-based DNA repair models. In particular. ur proposed framework is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy that uses a fast peeling algorithm to learn the DNA repair models. CRISPRLand captures lower-degree features around the cut site, which enrich for short insertions and deletions as well as higher-degree microhomology patterns that enrich for longer deletions.",

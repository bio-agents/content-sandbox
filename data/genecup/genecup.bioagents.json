Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Genetics Society of America.Interpreting and integrating results from omics studies typically requires a comprehensive and time consuming survey of extant literature. GeneCup is a literature mining web service that retrieves sentences containing user-provided gene symbols and keywords from PubMed abstracts. The keywords are organized into an ontology and can be extended to include results from human genome-wide association studies. We provide a drug addiction keyword ontology that contains over 300 keywords as an example. The literature search is conducted by querying the PubMed server using a programming interface, which is followed by retrieving abstracts from a local copy of the PubMed archive. The main results presented to the user are sentences where gene symbol and keywords co-occur. These sentences are presented through an interactive graphical interface or as tables. All results are linked to the original abstract in PubMed. In addition, a convolutional neural network is employed to distinguish sentences describing systemic stress from those describing cellular stress. The automated and comprehensive search strategy provided by GeneCup facilitates the integration of new discoveries from omic studies with existing literature. GeneCup is free and open source software. The source code of GeneCup and the link to a running instance is available at https://github.com/hakangunturkun/GeneCup.",

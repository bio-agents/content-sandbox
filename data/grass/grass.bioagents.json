Such tasks are usually accomplished starting from field-collected data, which typically suffer from intrinsic limitations such as accessibility constraints and punctuality of data collected. In this work, we explore the reliability of photo-geological mapping from interpretation of aerial photographs in providing data useful to build up 3D geological models. The test was conducted in a 15 km2 in Umbria, central Italy. The three-steps open source GIS procedure that outputs 3D models from photo-geological data was developed using python in GRASS GIS environment and GNU-Linux OS. We maintain that this procedure can have potential broad applications in Earth Sciences, including geological and structural analyses, up to the preliminary evaluation of potential reservoirs.",

Development of new, engaging visual aids is crucial to advancing our understanding of new findings. Results: We have developed MetaboCraft, a Minecraft plugin which creates immersive visualizations of metabolic networks and pathways in a 3D environment and allows the results of user experiments to be viewed in this context, presenting a novel approach to exploring the metabolome.",

It is particularly useful for visualizing the splitting of layer lines typical of coiled coils. The program produces as output the diffraction diagram calculated for helices that are oriented along their axis but are randomly oriented in other directions. The results can be numerically analyzed and also visualized on-screen. The program has been applied to the diffraction patterns given by DNA and protein coiled coils.

The availability of standard collections of such high-quality data is important to design, evaluate and improve novel computational approaches to identify binding motifs on promoter sequences from related genes. ABS (http://genome.imim.es/datasets/abs2005/index.html) is a public database of known binding sites identified in promoters of orthologous vertebrate genes that have been manually curated from bibliography. We have annotated 650 experimental binding sites from 68 transcription factors and 100 orthologous target genes in human, mouse, rat or chicken genome sequences. Computational predictions and promoter alignment information are also provided for each entry. A simple and easy-to-use web interface facilitates data retrieval allowing different views of the information. In addition, the release 1.0 of ABS includes a customizable generator of artificial datasets based on the known sites contained in the collection and an evaluation agent to aid during the training and the assessment of motif-finding programs.",

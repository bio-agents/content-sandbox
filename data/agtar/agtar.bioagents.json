                "abstract": "Â© 2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: Recently, the rapid development of RNA-seq technologies has accelerated transcriptomics research. The accurate identification and quantification of transcripts based on RNA-seq data will facilitate the exploration of various potential biological mechanisms. However, due to the limitations of the current data analysis agents and RNA-seq technologies, full and accurate reconstruction of the transcriptome still faces many challenges. Results: We developed the adapted genetic algorithm (AGTAR) program, which can reliably assemble transcriptomes and estimate abundance based on RNA-seq data with or without genome annotation files. We defined a new concept, isoform junction abundance, to help enhance the accuracy of isoform identification and quantification. Isoform abundance and isoform junction abundance are estimated by an adapted genetic algorithm. The crossover and mutation probabilities of the algorithm can be adaptively adjusted to effectively prevent premature convergence. Both simulated and real data indicated that AGTAR's comprehensive ability to assemble transcripts is significantly superior to that achievable by the currently widely used agents with similar functions. Conclusions: AGTAR is a agent for identifying and quantifying transcripts from RNA-seq data. It has the advantages of higher accuracy and ease of use.

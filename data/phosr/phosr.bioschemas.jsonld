      "sc:description": "PhosR enables processing and functional analysis of phosphoproteomic data.\n\nPhosR is a package for the comprehensive analysis of phosphoproteomic data. There are two major components to PhosR: processing and downstream analysis. PhosR consists of various processing agents for phosphoproteomic data including filtering, imputation, normalisaton and batch correction, which enables integration of multiple phosphoproteomic datasets. Downstream analytical agents consists of site- and protein-centric pathway analysis to evaluate activities of kinases and signalling pathways, large-scale kinase-substrate annotation from dynamic phosphoproteomic profiling, and visualisation and construction of signalomes present in the phosphoproteomic data of interest.",

To validate the workflow and highlight its capabilities, hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations are performed for SPC/E water in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) and grand canonical (GC) ensembles as well as with Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). The hybrid MC/MD approach shows close agreement with reference MC simulations and has a computational efficiency that is 2 to 136 times greater than traditional Monte Carlo simulations. MC/MD simulations performed for water in a graphene slit pore illustrate significant gains in sampling efficiency when the coupled-decoupled configurational-bias MC (CD-CBMC) algorithm is used compared with simulations using a single unbiased random trial position. Simulations using CD-CBMC reach equilibrium with 25 times fewer cycles than simulations using a single unbiased random trial position, with a small increase in computational cost. In a more challenging application, hybrid grand canonical Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (GCMC/MD) simulations are used to hydrate a buried binding pocket in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Water occupancies produced by GCMC/MD simulations are in close agreement with crystallographically identified positions, and GCMC/MD simulations have a computational efficiency that is 5 times better than MD simulations. py-MCMD is available on GitHub at https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/py-MCMD.",

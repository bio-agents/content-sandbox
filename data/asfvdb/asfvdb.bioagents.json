Published by Oxford University Press.The recent outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in China and Europe have threatened the swine industry globally. To control the transmission of ASF virus (ASFV), we developed the African swine fever virus database (ASFVdb), an online data visualization and analysis platform for comparative genomics and proteomics. On the basis of known ASFV genes, ASFVdb reannotates the genomes of every strain and newly annotates 5352 possible open reading frames (ORFs) of 45 strains. Moreover, ASFVdb performs a thorough analysis of the population genetics of all the published genomes of ASFV strains and performs functional and structural predictions for all genes. Users can obtain not only basic information for each gene but also its distribution in strains and conserved or high mutation regions, possible subcellular location and topology. In the genome browser, ASFVdb provides a sliding window for results of population genetic analysis, which facilitates genetic and evolutionary analyses at the genomic level. The web interface was constructed based on SWAV 1.0. ASFVdb is freely accessible at http://asfvdb.popgenetics.net.",

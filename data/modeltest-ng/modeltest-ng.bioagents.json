Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.ModelTest-NG is a reimplementation from scratch of jModelTest and ProtTest, two popular agents for selecting the best-fit nucleotide and amino acid substitution models, respectively. ModelTest-NG is one to two orders of magnitude faster than jModelTest and ProtTest but equally accurate and introduces several new features, such as ascertainment bias correction, mixture, and free-rate models, or the automatic processing of single partitions.

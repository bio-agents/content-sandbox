description: The typical process of checking arguments in functions is iterative.  In
  this process, an error may be returned and the user may fix it only to receive another
  error on a different argument.  'ArgumentCheck' facilitates a more helpful way to
  perform argument checks allowing the programmer to run all of the checks and then
  return all of the errors and warnings in a single message.

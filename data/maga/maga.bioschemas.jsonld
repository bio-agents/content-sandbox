Based on a regular procedure usually done visually by experts, it looks for group-conserved residues in an alignment. Provided an alignment in FASTA format and a way to group the sequences in it, MAGA seeks to access an unexplored layer of information difficult to appreciate visually when many sequences are aligned, even for a trained bioinformatician.",

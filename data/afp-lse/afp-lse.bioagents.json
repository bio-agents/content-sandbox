                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).Species living in extremely cold environments resist the freezing conditions through antifreeze proteins (AFPs). Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures. In particular, the proposed method demonstrated a high Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.52, F-score of 0.49, and Youden’s index of 0.81 on an independent test dataset, thereby outperforming the existing methods for AFP prediction.",

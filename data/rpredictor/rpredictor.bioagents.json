This led us to the idea to use existing layouts as templates for the visualization of new RNAs similarly to how templates are used in homology-based structure prediction. Results: This article introduces Traveler, a software agent enabling visualization of a target RNA secondary structure using an existing layout of a sufficiently similar RNA structure as a template. Traveler is based on an algorithm which converts the target and template structures into corresponding tree representations and utilizes tree edit distance coupled with layout modification operations to transform the template layout into the target one. Traveler thus accepts a pair of secondary structures and a template layout and outputs a layout for the target structure. Conclusions: Traveler is a command-line open source agent able to quickly generate layouts for even the largest RNA structures in the presence of a sufficiently similar layout.

At the same time, extant approaches to computational RNA structure prediction have limited applicability and reliability. In this paper we provide a method to solve a simpler yet still biologically relevant problem: prediction of secondary RNA structure using structure of different molecules as a template. Our method identifies conserved and unconserved subsequences within an RNA molecule. For conserved subsequences, the template structure is directly transferred into the generated structure and combined with de-novo predicted structure for the unconserved subsequences with low evolutionary conservation. The method also determines, when the generated structure is unreliable. The method is validated using experimentally identified structures. The accuracy of the method exceeds that of classical prediction algorithms and constrained prediction methods. This is demonstrated by comparison using large number of heterogeneous RNAs. The presented method is fast and robust, and useful for various applications requiring knowledge of secondary structures of individual RNA sequences.",

Nevertheless, due to extreme technical difficulties, spatial (3D) structures have been resolved experimentally for only 14 organisms. Also, computational prediction of 3D rRNA structure is almost impossible, and prediction of secondary structure (the list of base pairs in the folded RNA), an important intermediate step between sequence and 3D structure that is used broadly in modeling of RNA structures, is in the case of rRNAs hindered by both extreme sequence length and high structure complexity. Here we present a proof-of-concept for an rRNA secondary structure prediction method that utilizes known structures as structural templates. Our template-based prediction algorithm determines those regions of the sequence for which structure is being predicted that are conserved well enough so that their secondary structure can be copied over from the template. The structure of the remaining, unconserved regions is predicted using a thermodynamic folding model. Applying a baseline implementation of our algorithm to the E. coli 16S rRNA, we have achieved state-of-the-art recall and precision using the structure of T. thermophilus 16S rRNA as a template.",

With RNAs readily sequenced, the question of their structural characterization is increasingly important. However, RNA structure is difficult to acquire. Its experimental identification is extremely technically demanding, while computational prediction is not accurate enough, especially for large structures of long sequences. We address this difficult situation with rPredictorDB, a predictive database of RNA secondary structures that aims to form a middle ground between experimentally identified structures in PDB and predicted consensus secondary structures in Rfam. The database contains individual secondary structures predicted using a agent for template-based prediction of RNA secondary structure for the homologs of the RNA families with at least one homolog with experimentally solved structure. Experimentally identified structures are used as the structural templates and thus the prediction has higher reliability than de novo predictions in Rfam. The sequences are downloaded from public resources. So far rPredictorDB covers 7365 RNAs with their secondary structures. Plots of the secondary structures use the Traveler package for readable display of RNAs with long sequences and complex structures, such as ribosomal RNAs. The RNAs in the output of rPredictorDB are extensively annotated and can be viewed, browsed, searched and downloaded according to taxonomic, sequence and structure data. Additionally, structure of user-provided sequences can be predicted using the templates stored in rPredictorDB.",

All rights reserved.Next-generation sequencing has paved the way for the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks as a powerful agent for understanding metabolic circuits in any organism. However, the visualization and extraction of knowledge from these large networks comprising thousands of reactions and metabolites is a current challenge in need of userfriendly agents. Here we present Fluxer (https://fluxer. umbc.edu), a free and open-access novel web application for the computation and visualization of genome-scalemetabolic flux networks. Any genomescale model based on the Systems Biology Markup Language can be uploaded to the agent, which automatically performs Flux Balance Analysis and computes different flux graphs for visualization and analysis. The major metabolic pathways for biomass growth or for biosynthesis of any metabolite can be interactively knocked-out, analyzed and visualized as a spanning tree, dendrogram or complete graph using different layouts. In addition, Fluxer can compute and visualize the k-shortest metabolic paths between any two metabolites or reactions to identify the main metabolic routes between two compounds of interest. The web application includes >80 wholegenome metabolic reconstructions of diverse organisms from bacteria to human, readily available for exploration. Fluxer enables the efficient analysis and visualization of genome-scale metabolic models toward the discovery of key metabolic pathways.",

Based on genomic regions of interest and selected TF motifs (settings), TFmotifView performs an overlap of the genomic regions with TF motif occurrences from the JASPAR database to generate three different outputs: (1) an enrichment table and scatterplot calculating the significance of motif occurrences in genomic regions compared to control regions, (2) a genomic view of the organisation of TF motifs in each genomic region including an option to export the motif positions into the UCSC genome browser, and (3) a metaplot summarising the position of TF motifs relative to the center of the regions.",

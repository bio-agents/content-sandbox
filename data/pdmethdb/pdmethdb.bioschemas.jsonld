      "sc:description": "A curated Parkinson's disease associated methylation information database.\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, of which the histopathological hallmark is the formation of Lewy bodies consisting of α-synuclein as the major component. α-Synuclein can sequester DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance DNA methylation enzyme, from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, leading to global DNA hypomethylation in human brain. As DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and there is no specific database storing PD associated methylation information, PDmethDB (Parkinson's Disease Methylation Database) aims to curate PD associated methylation information from literature to facilitate the study of the relationship between PD and methylation",

                "abstract": "© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Characterization and quantification of visual plant traits is often limited to the use of agents and software that were developed to address a specific context, making them unsuitable for other applications. CoverageAgent is flexible multi-purpose software capable of area calculation in cm2, as well as coverage area in percentages, suitable for a wide range of applications. Results: Here we present a novel, semi-automated and robust agent for detailed characterization of visual plant traits. We demonstrate and discuss the application of this agent to quantify a broad spectrum of plant phenotypes/traits such as: tissue culture parameters, ground surface covered by annual plant canopy, root and leaf projected surface area, and leaf senescence area ratio. The CoverageAgent software provides easy to use functions to analyze images. While use of CoverageAgent involves subjective operator color selections, applying them uniformly to full sets of samples makes it possible to provide quantitative comparison between test subjects. Conclusion: The agent is simple and straightforward, yet suitable for the quantification of biological and environmental effects on a wide variety of visual plant traits. This agent has been very useful in quantifying different plant phenotypes in several recently published studies, and may be useful for many applications.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.Resource Description Framework (RDF) is widely used for representing biomedical data in practical applications. With the increases of RDF-based applications, there is an emerging requirement of novel architectures to provide effective supports for the future RDF data explosion. Inspired by the success of the new designs in National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP (The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database) for managing the increasing data volumes using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), in this paper we present an effective mapping agent that allows data migrations from RDF to JSON for supporting future massive data explosions and releases. We firstly introduce a set of mapping rules, which transform an RDF format into the JSON format, and then present the corresponding transformation algorithm. On this basis, we develop an effective and user-friendly agent called RDF2JSON, which enables automating the process of RDF data extractions and the corresponding JSON data generations.",

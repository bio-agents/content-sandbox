    "description": "An update of the moonlighting proteins database.\n\nMoonProt – A Database for Moonlighting Proteins.\n\nA Database for Moonlighting Proteins.\n\nA moonlighting protein is a single protein that has multiple functions that are not due to gene fusions, multiple RNA splice variants or multiple proteolytic fragments. Moonlighting proteins do not include families of homologous proteins if the different functions are performed by different proteins in the protein family. They also do not include proteins that have multiple cellular roles but use the same biochemical function in each role. A single protein with multiple functions might seem surprising, but there are actually more than 100 examples of proteins that ‘moonlight’. The variety of functions, methods to switch between functions, ways they might benefit the organism, and proposed methods of evolving a second function suggest that many more moonlighting proteins are likely to be found.",

Moonlighting proteins have two or more physiologically relevant distinct biochemical or biophysical functions performed by a single polypeptide chain. Here, we describe an expansion in the database since our previous report in the Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research in 2018. For this release, the number of proteins annotated has been expanded to over 500 proteins and dozens of protein annotations have been updated with additional information, including more structures in the Protein Data Bank, compared with version 2.0. The new entries include more examples from humans, plants and archaea, more proteins involved in disease and proteins with different combinations of functions. More kinds of information about the proteins and the species in which they have multiple functions has been added, including CATH and SCOP classification of structure, known and predicted disorder, predicted transmembrane helices, type of organism, relationship of the protein to disease, and relationship of organism to cause of disease.",

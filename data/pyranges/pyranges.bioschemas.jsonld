The ranges can have an arbitrary number of meta-data fields, i.e. columns associated with them | PyRanges is in a beta state. We are extremely responsive to bug-reports, so if you have problems or come across unexpected behavior, please create an issue | GenomicRanges and genomic Rle-objects for Python | Feel free to ask questions of the type \"how do I do X with pyranges?\" on public forums like Stack Overflow, Bioinformatics Stack Exchange or Biostars. You can use endrebak85#gmail.com to point me to the question(s) | \"Finally ... This was what Python badly needed for years.\" - Heng Li",

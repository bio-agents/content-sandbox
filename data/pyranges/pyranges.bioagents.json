The ranges can have an arbitrary number of meta-data fields, i.e. columns associated with them | PyRanges is in a beta state. We are extremely responsive to bug-reports, so if you have problems or come across unexpected behavior, please create an issue | GenomicRanges and genomic Rle-objects for Python | Feel free to ask questions of the type \"how do I do X with pyranges?\" on public forums like Stack Overflow, Bioinformatics Stack Exchange or Biostars.

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: Complex genomic analyses often use sequences of simple set operations like intersection, overlap and nearest on genomic intervals. These operations, coupled with some custom programming, allow a wide range of analyses to be performed. To this end, we have written PyRanges, a data structure for representing and manipulating genomic intervals and their associated data in Python. Run single threaded on binary set operations, PyRanges is in median 2.3-9.6 times faster than the popular R GenomicRanges library and is equally memory efficient; run multi-threaded on 8 cores, our library is up to 123 times faster. PyRanges is therefore ideally suited both for individual analyses and as a foundation for future genomic libraries in Python.",

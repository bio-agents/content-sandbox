                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 He, Xiao, Chen, Zhu, Zhang and Deng.The interactions between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to alter gene expression and regulate genes on diseases. Since traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, most circRNA-miRNA interactions remain largely unknown. Developing computational approaches to large-scale explore the interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we proposed a graph convolutional neural network-based approach named GCNCMI to predict the potential interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs. GCNCMI first mines the potential interactions of adjacent nodes in the graph convolutional neural network and then recursively propagates interaction information on the graph convolutional layers. Finally, it unites the embedded representations generated by each layer to make the final prediction. In the five-fold cross-validation, GCNCMI achieved the highest AUC of 0.9312 and the highest AUPR of 0.9412. In addition, the case studies of two miRNAs, hsa-miR-622 and hsa-miR-149-5p, showed that our model has a good effect on predicting circRNA-miRNA interactions.

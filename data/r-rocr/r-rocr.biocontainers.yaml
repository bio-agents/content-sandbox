description: ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts, and precision/recall
  plots are popular examples of trade-off visualizations for specific pairs of performance
  measures. ROCR is a flexible agent for creating cutoff-parameterized 2D performance
  curves by freely combining two from over 25 performance measures (new performance
  measures can be added using a standard interface). Curves from different cross-validation
  or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations,
  standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the
  runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding
  curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of
  a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching
  mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three commands
  and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.

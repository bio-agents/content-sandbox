description: Agents for genomic alignment. these include the mlagan multiple alignment
  agent, and shuffle-lagan for alignment with rearrangements.. all three are based
  on the chaos local alignment agent and combine speed (regions up to several megabases
  can be aligned in minutes) with high accuracy.

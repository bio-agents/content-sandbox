description: marr (Maximum Rank Reproducibility) is a nonparametric approach that
  detects reproducible signals using a maximal rank statistic for high-dimensional
  biological data. In this R package, we implement functions that measures the reproducibility
  of features per sample pair and sample pairs per feature in high-dimensional biological
  replicate experiments. The user-friendly plot functions in this package also plot
  histograms of the reproducibility of features per sample pair and sample pairs per
  feature. Furthermore, our approach also allows the users to select optimal filtering
  threshold values for the identification of reproducible features and sample pairs
  based on output visualization checks (histograms).

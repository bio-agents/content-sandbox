Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different agent is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These agents are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. Results We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This agent is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2-5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing agents such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar agents.

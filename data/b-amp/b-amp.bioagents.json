                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2021 Mhade, Panse, Tendulkar, Awate, Narasimhan, Kadam, Yennamalli and Kaushik.Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized for their ability to target processes important for biofilm formation. Given the vast array of AMPs, identifying potential anti-biofilm candidates remains a significant challenge, and prompts the need for preliminary in silico investigations prior to extensive in vitro and in vivo studies. We have developed Biofilm-AMP (B-AMP), a curated 3D structural and functional repository of AMPs relevant to biofilm studies. In its current version, B-AMP contains predicted 3D structural models of 5544 AMPs (from the DRAMP database) developed using a suite of molecular modeling agents. The repository supports a user-friendly search, using source, name, DRAMP ID, and PepID (unique to B-AMP). Further, AMPs are annotated to existing biofilm literature, consisting of a vast library of over 10,000 articles, enhancing the functional capabilities of B-AMP. To provide an example of the usability of B-AMP, we use the sortase C biofilm target of the emerging pathogen Corynebacterium striatum as a case study. For this, 100 structural AMP models from B-AMP were subject to in silico protein-peptide molecular docking against the catalytic site residues of the C. striatum sortase C protein. Based on docking scores and interacting residues, we suggest a preference scale using which candidate AMPs could be taken up for further in silico, in vitro and in vivo testing. The 3D protein-peptide interaction models and preference scale are available in B-AMP. B-AMP is a comprehensive structural and functional repository of AMPs, and will serve as a starting point for future studies exploring AMPs for biofilm studies. B-AMP is freely available to the community at https://b-amp.karishmakaushiklab.com and will be regularly updated with AMP structures, interaction models with potential biofilm targets, and annotations to biofilm literature.",

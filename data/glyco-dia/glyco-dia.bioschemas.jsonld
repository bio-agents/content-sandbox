      "sc:description": "a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | Glyco-DIA is a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | The Glyco-DIA library consists of sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the five most common core1 O-glycan structures. Applying the Glyco-DIA library to human serum without enrichment for glycopeptides enabled us to identify and quantify 269 distinct glycopeptide sequences bearing up to 5 different core1 O-glycans from 159 glycoproteins in a singleshot analysis. The DIA method is expandable and widely applicable to different glycoproteomes, and it may represent a first step towards direct and comprehensive approach to glycoproteomics",

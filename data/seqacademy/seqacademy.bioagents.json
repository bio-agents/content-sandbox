                "abstract": "Â© 2018 Ather SH et al.Quantification of gene expression and characterization of gene transcript structures are central problems in molecular biology. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) are important methods, but can be cumbersome and difficult for beginners to learn. To teach interested students and scientists how to analyze RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data, we present a start-to-finish tutorial for analyzing RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data: SeqAcademy (source code: Https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/seqacademy, webpage: Http://www.seqacademy.org/). This user-friendly pipeline, fully written in Jupyter Notebook, emphasizes the use of publicly available RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data and strings together popular agents that bridge that gap between raw sequencing reads and biological insight. We demonstrate practical and conceptual considerations for various RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis steps with a biological use case - a previously published yeast experiment. This work complements existing sophisticated RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq pipelines designed for advanced users by gently introducing the critical components of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis to the novice bioinformatician. In conclusion, this well-documented pipeline will introduce state-of-the-art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis agents to beginning bioinformaticians and help facilitate the analysis of the burgeoning amounts of public RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data.",

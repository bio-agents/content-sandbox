description: dSimer is an R package which provides computation of nine methods for
  measuring disease-disease similarity, including a standard cosine similarity measure
  and eight function-based methods. The disease similarity matrix obtained from these
  nine methods can be visualized through heatmap and network. Biological data widely
  used in disease-disease associations study are also provided by dSimer.

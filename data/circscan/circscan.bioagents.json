Previous work suggested that epigenetic features might be related to circRNA expression. However, the contribution of epigenetic changes to circRNA expression has not been investigated systematically. Here, we built a machine learning framework named CIRCScan, to predict circRNA expression in various cell lines based on the sequence and epigenetic features. Results: The predicted accuracy of the expression status models was high with area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values of 0.89 0.92 and the false-positive rates of 0.17 0.25. Predicted expressed circRNAs were further validated by RNA-seq data. The performance of expression-level prediction models was also good with normalized root-mean-square errors of 0.28 0.30 and Pearson s correlation coefficient r over 0.4 in all cell lines, along with Spearman s correlation coefficient q of 0.33 0.46. Noteworthy, H3K79me2 was highly ranked in modeling both circRNA expression status and levels across different cells. Further analysis in additional nine cell lines demonstrated a significant enrichment of H3K79me2 in circRNA flanking intron regions, supporting the potential involvement of H3K79me2 in circRNA expression regulation.",

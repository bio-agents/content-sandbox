      "sc:description": "Squeegee is a de novo computational contamination detection agent for metagenomic samples. Computational analysis of host-associated microbiomes has opened the door to numerous discoveries relevant to human health and disease. However, contaminant sequences in metagenomic samples can potentially impact the interpretation of findings reported in microbiome studies, especially in low biomass environments. Our hypothesis is that contamination from DNA extraction kits or sampling lab environments will leave taxonomic bread crumbs across multiple distinct sample types, allowing for the detection of microbial contaminants when negative controls are unavailable.",

To use the simulation, download the repository from GitHub, save it to a new folder (e.g. notch-delta-model), and create a project in Unity by clicking “create a new project” and select that folder (it should contain only the Assets folder and the readme file). Do not import any package. Then, load one of the scenes in the Assets folder by double clicking it.",

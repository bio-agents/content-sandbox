    "description": "The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence (amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. Additionally to the prediction itself, a prediction profile is computed which allows for determining the strengths to which the individual residues are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also be visualized as curves or heatmaps.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and structure is one of the great challenges in biology. In the case of the ubiquitous coiled-coil motif, structure and occurrence have been described in extensive detail, but there is a lack of insight into the rules that govern oligomerization, i.e. how many α-helices form a given coiled coil. To shed new light on the formation of two- and three-stranded coiled coils, we developed a machine learning approach to identify rules in the form of weighted amino acid patterns. These rules form the basis of our classification agent, PrOCoil, which also visualizes the contribution of each individual amino acid to the overall oligomeric tendency of a given coiled-coil sequence. We discovered that sequence positions previously thought irrelevant to direct coiled-coil interaction have an undeniable impact on stoichiometry. Our rules also demystify the oligomerization behavior of the yeast transcription factor GCN4, which can now be described as a hybrid - part dimer and part trimer - with both theoretical and experimental justification. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

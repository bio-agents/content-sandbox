The HIO will allow researchers and clinicians alike to readily access standardised HI-related knowledge in a single location and promote collaborations and HI information sharing, including epidemiological, socio-environmental, biomedical, genetic and phenotypic information. It is worth noting, this ontology provides an illustration of the adaptability of the Sickle Cell Disease Ontology framework for use in developing a disease-specific ontology.",

  "sc:description": "The Structural Alignment Program for Proteins (STRAP) is a java-based program that can be run over the web using a Java Web Start enabled browser or downloaded and run as a stand-alone application. Alignments can be done using one of several methods, including ClustalW, JAligner and T_coffee. STRAP is also able to incorporate structure information and interfaces with programs such as Pymol and Rasmol. There is also a tutorial included.",

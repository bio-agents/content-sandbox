                "abstract": "Â© 2017 Yang Cao et al.Large amounts of various biological networks exist for representing different types of interaction data, such as genetic, metabolic, gene regulatory, and protein-protein relationships. Recent approaches on biological network study are based on different mathematical concepts. It is necessary to construct a uniform framework to judge the functionality of biological networks. We recently introduced a knowledge-based computational framework that reliably characterized biological networks in system level. The method worked by making systematic comparisons to a set of well-studied \"basic networks,\" measuring both the functional and topological similarities. A biological network could be characterized as a spectrum-like vector consisting of similarities to basic networks. Here, to facilitate the application, development, and adoption of this framework, we present an R package called NFP. This package extends our previous pipeline, offering a powerful set of functions for Network Fingerprint analysis. The software shows great potential in biological network study. The open source NFP R package is freely available under the GNU General Public License v2.0 at CRAN along with the vignette.",

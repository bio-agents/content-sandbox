Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Inferring homology relationships across genes in different species is a central task in comparative genomics. Therefore, a large number of resources and methods have been developed over the years. Some public databases include phylogenetic trees of homologous gene families which can be used to further differentiate homology relationships into orthology and paralogy. MetaPhOrs is a web server that integrates phylogenetic information from different sources to provide orthology and paralogy relationships based on a common phylogeny-based predictive algorithm and associated with a consistency-based confidence score. Here we describe the latest version of the web server which includes major new implementations and provides orthology and paralogy relationships derived from ∼8.2 million gene family trees––from 13 different source repositories across ∼4000 species with sequenced genomes. MetaPhOrs server is freely available, without registration, at http://orthology.phylomedb.org/.",

                "abstract": "Reliable prediction of orthology is central to comparative genomics. Approaches based on phylogenetic analyses closely resemble the original definition of orthology and paralogy and are known to be highly accurate. However, the large computational cost associated to these analyses is a limiting factor that often prevents its use at genomic scales. Recently, several projects have addressed the reconstruction of large collections of high-quality phylogenetic trees from which orthology and paralogy relationships can be inferred. This provides us with the opportunity to infer the evolutionary relationships of genes from multiple, independent, phylogenetic trees. Using such strategy, we combine phylogenetic information derived from different databases, to predict orthology and paralogy relationships for 4.1 million proteins in 829 fully sequenced genomes. We show that the number of independent sources from which a prediction is made, as well as the level of consistency across predictions, can be used as reliable confidence scores. A webserver has been developed to easily access these data (http://orthology.phylomedb.org), which provides users with a global repository of phylogeny-based orthology and paralogy predictions. © 2010 The Author(s).",

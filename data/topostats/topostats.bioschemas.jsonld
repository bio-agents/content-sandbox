      "sc:description": "An AFM image analysis program to batch process data and obtain statistics from images.\n\nImage progessing is performed using the 'pygwytracing' script.\n\nThe algorithm searches recursively for files within a user-defined directory. This search also excludes any files of the format ‘_cs’ which are cropped files exported by the Nanoscope Analysis software. AFM images are loaded using gwyddion functions and topography data is automatically selected using the choosechannels function. The pixel size and dimensions of each image are determined using the imagedetails function, which allows all inputs to be specified in real, i.e. nanometre values, in place of pixel values. This is especially important for datasets with changing resolution.",

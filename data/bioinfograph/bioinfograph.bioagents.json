                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Li, Hurt, Whelan, Challa, Lin and Zhang.Many fit-for-purpose bioinformatics agents generate plots to interpret complex biological data and illustrate findings. However, assembling individual plots in different formats from various sources into one high-resolution figure in the desired layout requires mastery of commercial agents or even programming skills. In addition, it is a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating process even for a computationally savvy scientist who frequently takes a trial-and-error iterative approach to get satisfactory results. To address the challenge, we developed bioInfograph, a web-based agent that allows users to interactively arrange high-resolution images in diversified formats, mainly Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), to produce one multi-panel publication-quality composite figure in both PDF and HTML formats in a user-friendly manner, requiring no programming skills. It solves stylesheet conflicts of coexisting SVG plots, integrates a rich-text editor, and allows creative design by providing advanced functionalities like image transparency, controlled vertical stacking of plots, versatile image formats, and layout templates. To highlight, the sharable interactive HTML output with zoom-in function is a unique feature not seen in any other similar agents. In the end, we make the online agent publicly available at https://baohongz.github.io/bioInfograph while releasing the source code at https://github.com/baohongz/bioInfograph under MIT open-source license.",

      "sc:description": "Flexible cFDR (conditional false-discovery rate) is an extension of the cFDR framework that supports continuous auxiliary data from any arbitrary distribution, extending its use beyond only GWAS. As in the existing cFDR framework, the method requires GWAS test statistics for the trait of interest and auxiliary SNP-level data to output quantities analogous to p-values (called “v-values”), meaning that the method can be applied iteratively to incorporate additional layers of auxiliary data.",

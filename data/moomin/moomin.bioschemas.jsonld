      "sc:description": "Mathematical explOration of 'Omics data on a MetabolIc Network | MOOMIN is a agent for analysing differential expression data | MOOMIN (Mathematical explOration of Omics data on a MetabolIc Network) is a agent for analysing differential expression data. It takes as its input a metabolic network and the results of a DE analysis: a posterior probability of differential expression and a (logarithm of a) fold change for a list of genes. It then forms a hypothesis of a metabolic shift, determining for each reaction its status as \"increased flux\", \"decreased flux\", or \"no change\". These are expressed as colours: red for an increase, blue for a decrease, and grey for no change. See the paper for full details: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz584",

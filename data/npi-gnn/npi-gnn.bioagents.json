For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in many biological processes. Experimental methods for identifying ncRNA-protein interactions (NPIs) are always costly and time-consuming. Many computational approaches have been developed as alternative ways. In this work, we collected five benchmarking datasets for predicting NPIs. Based on these datasets, we evaluated and compared the prediction performances of existing machine-learning based methods. Graph neural network (GNN) is a recently developed deep learning algorithm for link predictions on complex networks, which has never been applied in predicting NPIs. We constructed a GNN-based method, which is called Noncoding RNA-Protein Interaction prediction using Graph Neural Networks (NPI-GNN), to predict NPIs. The NPI-GNN method achieved comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods in a 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, it is capable of predicting novel interactions based on network information and sequence information. We also found that insufficient sequence information does not affect the NPI-GNN prediction performance much, which makes NPI-GNN more robust than other methods. As far as we can tell, NPI-GNN is the first end-to-end GNN predictor for predicting NPIs. All benchmarking datasets in this work and all source codes of the NPI-GNN method have been deposited with documents in a GitHub repo (https://github.com/AshuiRUA/NPI-GNN).",

                "abstract": "Â© 2017 Soto, Zheng, Fonseca and Ashby.Determining whether perceptual properties are processed independently is an important goal in perceptual science, and agents to test independence should be widely available to experimental researchers. The best analytical agents to test for perceptual independence are provided by General Recognition Theory (GRT), a multidimensional extension of signal detection theory. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of software implementing GRT analyses that is ready-to-use by experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little training in computational modeling. This paper presents gragents, an R package developed with the explicit aim of providing experimentalists with the ability to perform full GRT analyses using only a couple of command lines. We describe the software and provide a practical tutorial on how to perform each of the analyses available in gragents. We also provide advice to researchers on best practices for experimental design and interpretation of results when applying GRT and gragents.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.Objective: Cross-institutional distributed healthcare/genomic predictive modeling is an emerging technology that fulfills both the need of building a more generalizable model and of protecting patient data by only exchanging the models but not the patient data. In this article, the implementation details are presented for one specific blockchain-based approach, ExplorerChain, from a software development perspective. The healthcare/ genomic use cases of myocardial infarction, cancer biomarker, and length of hospitalization after surgery are also described. Materials and Methods: ExplorerChain's 3 main technical components, including online machine learning, metadata of transaction, and the Proof-of-Information-Timed (PoINT) algorithm, are introduced in this study. Specifically, the 3 algorithms (ie, core, new network, and new site/data) are described in detail. Results: ExplorerChain was implemented and the design details of it were illustrated, especially the development configurations in a practical setting. Also, the system architecture and programming languages are introduced. The code was also released in an open source repository available at https://github.com/tsungtingkuo/ explorerchain. Discussion: The designing considerations of semi-trust assumption, data format normalization, and non-determinism was discussed. The limitations of the implementation include fixed-number participating sites, limited join-or-leave capability during initialization, advanced privacy technology yet to be included, and further investigation in ethical, legal, and social implications. Conclusion: This study can serve as a reference for the researchers who would like to implement and even deploy blockchain technology. Furthermore, the off-the-shelf software can also serve as a cornerstone to accelerate the development and investigation of future healthcare/genomic blockchain studies.",

All rights reserved.Effectors are small, secreted proteins that facilitate infection of host plants by all major groups of plant pathogens. Effector protein identification in oomycetes relies on identification of open reading frames with certain amino acid motifs among additional minor criteria. To date, identification of effectors relies on custom scripts to identify motifs in candidate open reading frames. Here, we developed the R package effectR, which provides a convenient agent for rapid prediction of effectors in oomycete genomes, or with custom scripts for any genome, in a reproducible way. The effectR package relies on a combination of regular expressions statements and hidden Markov model approaches to predict candidate RxLR and crinkler effectors. Other custom motifs for novel effectors can easily be implemented and added to package updates. The effectR package has been validated with published oomycete genomes. This package provides a convenient agent for wet lab researchers interested in reproducible identification of candidate effectors in oomycete genomes.",

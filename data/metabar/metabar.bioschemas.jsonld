It provides functions to reveal and filter common molecular artifacts produced during the experimental workflow.\n\nThis package can be easily used in combination with others R packages commonly used in ecology (vegan, ade4, ape, picante, etc.), and provides flexible graphic systems based on ggplot2 to visualise the data under both ecological and experimental perspectives.",

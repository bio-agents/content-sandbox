    "description": "MotifSampler tries to find over-represented motifs in the upstream region of a set of co-regulated genes. This motif finding algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to find the position probability matrix that represents the motif. In this implementation we focus on the use of higher-order background models to improve the robustness of the motif finding. At the moment the MotifSampler comes with background models for several organisms .",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Transcriptome analysis allows detection and clustering of genes that are coexpressed under various biological circumstances. Under the assumption that coregulated genes share cis-acting regulatory elements, it is important to investigate the upstream sequences controlling the transcription of these genes. To improve the robustness of the Gibbs sampling algorithm to noisy data sets we propose an extension of this algorithm for motif finding with a higher-order background model. Results: Simulated data and real biological data sets with well-described regulatory elements are used to test the influence of the different background models on the performance of the motif detection algorithm. We show that the use of a higher-order model considerably enhances the performance of our motif finding algorithm in the presence of noisy data. For Arabidopsis thaliana, a reliable background model based on a set of carefully selected intergenic sequences was constructed.",

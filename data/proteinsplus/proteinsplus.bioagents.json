The ProteinsPlus web service (https://proteins.plus) offers a broad range of agents addressing these challenges. The web interface to the agent collection focusing on protein–ligand interactions has been geared towards easy and intuitive access to a large variety of functionality for life scientists. Since our last publication, the ProteinsPlus web service has been extended by additional services as well as it has undergone substantial infrastructural improvements. A keyword search functionality was added on the start page of ProteinsPlus enabling users to work on structures without knowing their PDB code. The agent collection has been augmented by three agents: StructureProfiler validates ligands and active sites using selection criteria of well-established protein–ligand benchmark data sets, WarPP places water molecules in the lig- and binding sites of a protein, and METALizer calculates, predicts and scores coordination geometries of metal ions based on surrounding complex atoms. Additionally, all agents provided by ProteinsPlus are available through a REST service enabling the automated integration in structure processing and modeling pipelines.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.With currently more than 126 000 publicly available structures and an increasing growth rate, the Protein Data Bank constitutes a rich data source for structure-driven research in fields like drug discovery, crop science and biotechnology in general. Typical workflows in these areas involve manifold computational agents for the analysis and prediction of molecular functions. Here, we present the ProteinsPlus web server that offers a unified easy-to-use interface to a broad range of agents for the early phase of structure-based molecular modeling. This includes solutions for commonly required pre-processing tasks like structure quality assessment (EDIA), hydrogen placement (Protoss) and the search for alternative conformations (SIENA). Beyond that, it also addresses frequent problems as the generation of 2D-interaction diagrams (PoseView), protein-protein interface classification (HyPPI) as well as automatic pocket detection and druggablity assessment (DoGSiteScorer). The unified ProteinsPlus interface covering all featured approaches provides various facilities for intuitive input and result visualization, case-specific parameterization and download options for further processing. Moreover, its generalized workflow allows the user a quick familiarization with the different agents. ProteinsPlus also stores the calculated results temporarily for future request and thus facilitates convenient result communication and re-access.",

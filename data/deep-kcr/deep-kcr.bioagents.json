For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.As a newly discovered protein posttranslational modification, histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) involved in cellular regulation and human diseases. Various proteomics technologies have been developed to detect Kcr sites. However, experimental approaches for identifying Kcr sites are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which is difficult to widely popularize in large-scale species. Computational approaches are cost-effective and can be used in a high-throughput manner to generate relatively precise identification. In this study, we develop a deep learning-based method termed as Deep-Kcr for Kcr sites prediction by combining sequence-based features, physicochemical property-based features and numerical space-derived information with information gain feature selection. We investigate the performances of convolutional neural network (CNN) and five commonly used classifiers (long short-term memory network, random forest, LogitBoost, naive Bayes and logistic regression) using 10-fold cross-validation and independent set test. Results show that CNN could always display the best performance with high computational efficiency on large dataset. We also compare the Deep-Kcr with other existing agents to demonstrate the excellent predictive power and robustness of our method. Based on the proposed model, a webserver called Deep-Kcr was established and is freely accessible at http://lin-group.cn/server/Deep-Kcr.",

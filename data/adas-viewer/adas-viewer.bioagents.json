                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is represented by complicated biological mechanisms and complexity of brain tissue. Our understanding of the complicated molecular architecture that contributes to AD progression benefits from performing comprehensive and systemic investigations with multi-layered molecular and biological data from different brain regions. Since recently different independent studies generated various omics data in different brain regions of AD patients, multi-omics data integration can be a useful resource for better comprehensive understanding of AD. Here we present a web platform, ADAS-viewer, that provides researchers with the ability to comprehensively investigate and visualize multi-omics data from multiple brain regions of AD patients. ADAS-viewer offers means to identify functional changes in transcript and exon expression (i.e., alternative splicing) along with associated genetic or epigenetic regulatory effects. Specifically, it integrates genomic, transcriptomic, methylation, and miRNA data collected from seven different brain regions (cerebellum, temporal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus) across three independent cohort datasets. ADAS-viewer is particularly useful as a web-based application for analyzing and visualizing multi-omics data across multiple brain regions at both transcript and exon level, allowing the identification of candidate biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.",

  description: Fast Imputation Based on State Space Reduction HMM
  long_description: " Minimac4 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient\
    \ implementation\n of \"minimac2/3\". It is an algorithm for genotypic imputation\
    \ that works on\n phased genotypes (say from MaCH).\n .\n Minimac4 is designed\
    \ to handle very large reference panels in a more\n computationally efficient\
    \ way with no loss of accuracy. This algorithm\n analyzes only the unique sets\
    \ of haplotypes in small genomic segments, thereby\n saving on time\\-complexity,\
    \ computational memory but no loss in degree of\n accuracy.\n"

We present MntJULiP, a novel method for comprehensive and accurate quantification of splicing differences between two or more conditions. MntJULiP detects both changes in intron splicing ratios and changes in absolute splicing levels with high accuracy, and can find classes of variation overlooked by other agents. MntJULiP identifies over 29,000 differentially spliced introns in 1398 GTEx brain samples, including 11,242 novel introns discovered in this dataset. Highly scalable, MntJULiP can process thousands of samples within hours to reveal splicing constituents of phenotypic differentiation.",

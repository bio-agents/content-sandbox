Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.For the reproducibility and sustainability of scientific research, FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), with respect to the release of raw data obtained by researchers, is one of the most important principles underpinning the future of open science. In genomics and transcriptomics, the sharing of raw data from next-generation sequencers is made possible through public repositories. In addition, in proteomics, the deposition of raw data from mass spectrometry (MS) experiments into repositories is becoming standardized. However, a standard repository for such MS data had not yet been established in glycomics. With the increasing number of glycomics MS data, therefore, we have developed GlycoPOST (https://glycopost.glycosmos.org/), a repository for raw MS data generated from glycomics experiments. In just the first year since the release of GlycoPOST, 73 projects have already been registered by researchers around the world, and the number of registered projects is continuously growing, making a significant contribution to the future FAIRness of the glycomics field. GlycoPOST is a free resource to the community and accepts (and will continue to accept in the future) raw data regardless of vendor-specific formats.",

Such xml files belong to a cognitive task experimented using Bussey-Saksida Mouse Touchscreen System and exported via ABET II software. Note that each xml file must contain the machine-generated (ABET II) features like \"Analysis Name\", \"Schedule Name\", \"Max_Number_Trials\", and \"Max_Schedule_Time\"",

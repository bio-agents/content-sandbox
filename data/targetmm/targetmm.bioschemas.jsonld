      "sc:description": "accurate missense mutation prediction by utilizing local and global sequence information with classifier ensemble.\n\nTargetMM: Missense mutation is one kind of Single Nucleotide Variations, which might likely cause diseade or even cancer.TargetMM utilize evaluationary information, such as PSSM and predicted Secondary Structure information, and Disorder region of proteins. In addition, we also consider protein global features, such as APAAC and PAAC. On the training data, we trained and validated SVM, RF,and GPC models. Then,intergate them together to form an ensemble classifier model. We compare TargetMM with four existing prediction methods,such as, SIFT, PROVEAN, FATHMM, and PolyPhen-2. The comparision results showed that TargetMM has much higher MCC than that of all these four methods.",

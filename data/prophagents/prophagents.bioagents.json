As such, there exist multiple methods to extract knowledge from biological networks. However, these approaches usually limit their scope to a single biological entity type of interest or they lack the flexibility to analyze user-defined data. Results: We developed ProphAgents, a flexible open-source command-line agent that performs prioritization on a heterogeneous network. ProphAgents prioritization combines a Flow Propagation algorithm similar to a Random Walk with Restarts and a weighted propagation method. A flexible model for the representation of a heterogeneous network allows the user to define a prioritization problem involving an arbitrary number of entity types and their interconnections. Furthermore, ProphAgents provides functionality to perform cross-validation tests, allowing users to select the best network configuration for a given problem. ProphAgents core prioritization methodology has already been proven effective in gene-disease prioritization and drug repositioning. Here we make ProphAgents available to the scientific community as flexible, open-source software and perform a new proof-of-concept case study on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to disease prioritization. Conclusions: ProphAgents is robust prioritization software that provides the flexibility not present in other state-of-the-art network analysis approaches, enabling researchers to perform prioritization tasks on any user-defined heterogeneous network. Furthermore, the application to lncRNA-disease prioritization shows that ProphAgents can reach the performance levels of ad hoc prioritization agents without losing its generality.",

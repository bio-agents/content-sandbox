                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Chen, Zhang, Li, Lu, Yang, Long, He, Chen and Huang.Blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major barrier to drug delivery into the brain in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Blood-brain barrier penetrating peptides (BBPs), a class of peptides that can cross BBB through various mechanisms without damaging BBB, are effective drug candidates for CNS diseases. However, identification of BBPs by experimental methods is time-consuming and laborious. To discover more BBPs as drugs for CNS disease, it is urgent to develop computational methods that can quickly and accurately identify BBPs and non-BBPs. In the present study, we created a training dataset that consists of 326 BBPs derived from previous databases and published manuscripts and 326 non-BBPs collected from UniProt, to construct a BBP predictor based on sequence information. We also constructed an independent testing dataset with 99 BBPs and 99 non-BBPs. Multiple machine learning methods were compared based on the training dataset via a nested cross-validation. The final BBP predictor was constructed based on the training dataset and the results showed that random forest (RF) method outperformed other classification algorithms on the training and independent testing dataset. Compared with previous BBP prediction agents, the RF-based predictor, named BBPpredict, performs considerably better than state-of-the-art BBP predictors. BBPpredict is expected to contribute to the discovery of novel BBPs, or at least can be a useful complement to the existing methods in this area.

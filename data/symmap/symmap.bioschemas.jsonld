      "sc:description": "An integrative database of traditional Chinese medicine enhanced by symptom mapping.\n\nSymMap integrates traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with modern medicine (MM) through both internal molecular mechanism and external symptom mapping.\n\nIt contains 499 herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopoeia with 19,595 ingredients, and 1,717 corresponding symptoms used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM symtptom). Those TCM symptoms were rigorously mapped to 961 symptom terms used in modern medicine (MM symptom). Furthermore, SymMap collected associated targets (gene) and diseases for these herbs, either by symptom-disease associations, or by ingredient-target relationships. In total, 4,302 targets and 5,235 diseases were included in SymMap.",

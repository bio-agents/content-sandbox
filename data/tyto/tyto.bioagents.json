                "abstract": "Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.As synthetic biology becomes increasingly automated and data-driven, agents that help researchers implement FAIR (findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable) data management practices are needed. Crucially, in order to support machine processing and reusability of data, it is important that data artifacts are appropriately annotated with metadata drawn from controlled vocabularies. Unfortunately, adopting standardized annotation practices is difficult for many research groups to adopt, given the set of specialized database science skills usually required to interface with ontologies. In response to this need, Take Your Terms from Ontologies (Tyto) is a lightweight Python agent that supports the use of controlled vocabularies in everyday scripting practice. While Tyto has been developed for synthetic biology applications, its utility may extend to users working in other areas of bioinformatics research as well. Tyto is available as a Python package distribution or available as source at https://github.com/SynBioDex/tyto.",

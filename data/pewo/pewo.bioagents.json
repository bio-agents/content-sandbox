All rights reserved.Motivation: Phylogenetic placement (PP) is a process of taxonomic identification for which several agents are now available. However, it remains difficult to assess which agent is more adapted to particular genomic data or a particular reference taxonomy. We developed Placement Evaluation WOrkflows (PEWO), the first benchmarking agent dedicated to PP assessment. Its automated workflows can evaluate PP at many levels, from parameter optimization for a particular agent, to the selection of the most appropriate genetic marker when PP-based species identifications are targeted. Our goal is that PEWO will become a community effort and a standard support for future developments and applications of PP. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/phylo42/PEWO.",

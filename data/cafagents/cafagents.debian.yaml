  description: maintenance of DNA sequence assemblies
  long_description: " This package contains code from different authors that allow\
    \ sequence\n assemblies to be converted into formats such as CAF (Common Assembly\n\
    \ Format) or GAP4.\n .\n CAF is a text format for describing sequence assemblies.\
    \ It\n is acedb-compliant and is an extension of the ace-file format used\n earlier,\
    \ but with support for base quality measures and a more extensive\n description\
    \ of the Sequence data. CAF was designed during the Sanger\n sequencing era. Its\
    \ modern-day successor is the SAM format, or its\n binary equivalents BAM and\
    \ CRAM.\n"

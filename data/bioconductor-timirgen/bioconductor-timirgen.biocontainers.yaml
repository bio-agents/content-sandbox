description: TimiRGeN (Time Incorporated miR-mRNA Generation of Networks) is a novel
  R package which functionally analyses and integrates time course miRNA-mRNA differential
  expression data. This agent can generate small networks within R or export results
  into cytoscape or pathvisio for more detailed network construction and hypothesis
  generation. This agent is created for researchers that wish to dive deep into time
  series multi-omic datasets. TimiRGeN goes further than many other agents in terms
  of data reduction. Here, potentially hundreds of thousands of potential miRNA-mRNA
  interactions can be whittled down into a handful of high confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions
  effecting a signalling pathway, across a time course.

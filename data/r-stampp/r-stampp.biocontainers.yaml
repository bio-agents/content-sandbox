description: Allows users to calculate pairwise Nei's Genetic Distances (Nei 1972),
  pairwise Fixation Indexes (Fst) (Weir & Cockerham 1984) and also Genomic Relationship
  matrixes following Yang et al. (2010) in mixed and single ploidy populations. Bootstrapping
  across loci is implemented during Fst calculation to generate confidence intervals
  and p-values around pairwise Fst values. StAMPP utilises SNP genotype data of any
  ploidy level (with the ability to handle missing data) and is coded to utilise multithreading
  where available to allow efficient analysis of large datasets. StAMPP is able to
  handle genotype data from genlight objects allowing integration with other packages
  such adegenet.

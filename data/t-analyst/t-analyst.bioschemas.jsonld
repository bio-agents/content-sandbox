  "sc:description": "A program for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories based on internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates. The program computes entropy and rotameric states of dihedrals, clusters multiple conformations and detects dihedral rotations that contribute hinge-like motions. It was developed with special focuses on showing changes of protein flexibility between different states, and selecting representative protein conformations for molecular docking studies.",

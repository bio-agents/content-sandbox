      "sc:description": "Robust Inference of Kinase Activity Using Functional Networks.\n\nRoKAI is a computation agent for inferring kinase activity in a robust manner using functional networks.\n\nRoKAI operates on a heterogeneous network having kinases and phosphosites as nodes and available functional associations as edges, including protein-protein interactions, kinase-substrate annotations, co-evolution and structure distance evidence between phosphosites. The key idea of RoKAI is to propagate the phosphosite quantifications on this heterogeneous network to capture the coordinated changes in the signaling, which are used to infer the kinase activities in a more robust manner.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Authors. Software:Practice and Experience published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The race for innovation has turned into a race for data. Rapid developments of new technologies, especially in the field of artificial intelligence, are accompanied by new ways of accessing, integrating, and analyzing sensitive personal data. Examples include financial transactions, social network activities, location traces, and medical records. As a consequence, adequate and careful privacy management has become a significant challenge. New data protection regulations, for example in the EU and China, are direct responses to these developments. Data anonymization is an important building block of data protection concepts, as it allows to reduce privacy risks by altering data. The development of anonymization agents involves significant challenges, however. For instance, the effectiveness of different anonymization techniques depends on context, and thus agents need to support a large set of methods to ensure that the usefulness of data is not overly affected by risk-reducing transformations. In spite of these requirements, existing solutions typically only support a small set of methods. In this work, we describe how we have extended an open source data anonymization agent to support almost arbitrary combinations of a wide range of techniques in a scalable manner. We then review the spectrum of methods supported and discuss their compatibility within the novel framework. The results of an extensive experimental comparison show that our approach outperforms related solutions in terms of scalability and output data quality—while supporting a much broader range of techniques. Finally, we discuss practical experiences with ARX and present remaining issues and challenges ahead.",

To support evidence-generation at the rapid pace required in a pandemic, LEOSS follows an Open Science approach, making data available to the public in real-time. To protect patient privacy, quantitative anonymization procedures are used to protect the continuously published data stream consisting of 16 variables on the course and therapy of COVID-19 from singling out, inference and linkage attacks. We investigated the bias introduced by this process and found that it has very little impact on the quality of output data. Current laws do not specify requirements for the application of formal anonymization methods, there is a lack of guidelines with clear recommendations and few real-world applications of quantitative anonymization procedures have been described in the literature. We therefore believe that our work can help others with developing urgently needed anonymization pipelines for their projects.",

GreenCircRNA(v1.0) is the most comprehensive database containing 213,494 circRNA informations from over 4100 RNA-seq datasets across 69 different species. Based on these candidate circRNAs, we futher predicted them acting as miRNA decoys and their potential networks involving circRNA-miRNA-mRNA in the corresponding species. This database allows users not only to search, browse and freely download circRNAs with relative informations, such as full-length, graphical, parental gene and interaction network, but also provide some agents for analyze circRNAs.\n\nA Wiki-database of plant CircRNAs(v1.0).",

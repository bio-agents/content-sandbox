description: Existing CRIPSR gRNA design agents target protein-coding regions within
  genomic loci and non-specifically target the entire input region of DNA. Current
  agents fail to consider proteomic-based applications, so CRISPR-TAPE has been developed
  to reduce the substantial time burden associated with manual curation of gRNA libraries
  and empower the proteomics community.

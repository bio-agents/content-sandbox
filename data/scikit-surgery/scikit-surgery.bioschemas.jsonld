      "sc:description": "Compact libraries for surgical navigation.\n\nThis paper introduces the SciKit-Surgery libraries, designed to enable rapid development of clinical applications for image-guided interventions. SciKit-Surgery implements a family of compact, orthogonal, libraries accompanied by robust testing, documentation, and quality control. SciKit-Surgery libraries can be rapidly assembled into testable clinical applications and subsequently translated to production software without the need for software reimplementation. The aim is to support translation from single surgeon trials to multicentre trials in under 2 years. METHODS:At the time of publication, there were 13 SciKit-Surgery libraries provide functionality for visualisation and augmented reality in surgery, together with hardware interfaces for video, tracking, and ultrasound sources. The libraries are stand-alone, open source, and provide Python interfaces",

description: This agent aims at infering biological networks, in particular signaling
  and gene networks. for that it takes perturbation data, either steady-state or time-series,
  as input and generates an lp model which allows the inference of signaling networks.
  for parameter identification either leave-one-out cross-validation or stratified
  n-fold cross-validation can be used.

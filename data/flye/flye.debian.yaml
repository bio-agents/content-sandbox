  description: de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads using repeat
    graphs
  long_description: " Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads,\
    \ such\n as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is\n\
    \ designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to\n large\
    \ mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete\n pipeline: it\
    \ takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished\n contigs. Flye also\
    \ has a special mode for metagenome assembly."

    "description": "Model-based analysis of proteomic data to detect proteins with significant abundance changes.\n\nMAP (Model-based Analysis of Proteomic data), is designed to statistically compare the proteomic profiles generated from different biological samples using the isotope labeling based mass spectrometry (MS) technique and directly identify proteins with significant abundance changes. Unlike many existing agents for this purpose, it does not require parallel/additional technical replicates to fathom technical variations; instead, MAP uses a novel step-by-step regression analysis to directly model technical variations from the profiles under comparison. Therefore, experimental designs and their expenses can be simplified and reduced for more practices",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019, The Author(s).Isotope-labeling-based mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in quantitative proteomic studies. With this technique, the relative abundance of thousands of proteins can be efficiently profiled in parallel, greatly facilitating the detection of proteins differentially expressed across samples. However, this task remains computationally challenging. Here we present a new approach, termed Model-based Analysis of Proteomic data (MAP), for this task. Unlike many existing methods, MAP does not require technical replicates to model technical and systematic errors, and instead utilizes a novel step-by-step regression analysis to directly assess the significance of observed protein abundance changes. We applied MAP to compare the proteomic profiles of undifferentiated and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and found it has superior performance compared with existing agents in detecting proteins differentially expressed during mESC differentiation. A web-based application of MAP is provided for online data processing at http://bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/shaolab/MAP.",

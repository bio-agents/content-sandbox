                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Zheng et al.Dietary polyphenols can significantly benefit human health, but their bioavailability is metabolically controlled by human gut microbiota. To facilitate the study of polyphenol metabolism for human gut health, we have manually curated experimentally characterized polyphenol utilization proteins (PUPs) from published literature. This resulted in 60 experimentally characterized PUPs (named seeds) with various metadata, such as species and substrate. Further database search found 107,851 homologs of the seeds from UniProt and UHGP (unified human gastrointestinal protein) databases. All PUP seeds and homologs were classified into protein classes, families, and subfamilies based on Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, Pfam (protein family) domains, and sequence similarity networks. By locating PUP homologs in the genomes of UHGP, we have identified 1,074 physically linked PUP gene clusters (PGCs), which are potentially involved in polyphenol metabolism in the human gut. The gut microbiome of Africans was consistently ranked the top in terms of the abundance and prevalence of PUP homologs and PGCs among all geographical continents. This reflects the fact that dietary polyphenols are consumed by the African population more commonly than by other populations, such as Europeans and North Americans. A case study of the Hadza hunter-gatherer microbiome verified the feasibility of using dbPUP to profile metagenomic data for biologically meaningful discovery, suggesting an association between diet and PUP abundance. A Pfam domain enrichment analysis of PGCs identified a number of putatively novel PUP families. Lastly, a user-friendly web interface (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbpup/) provides all the data online to facilitate the research of polyphenol metabolism for improved human health. IMPORTANCE Long-term consumption of polyphenol-rich foods has been shown to lower the risk of various human diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and metabolic diseases. Raw polyphenols are often enzymatically processed by gut microbiome, which contains various polyphenol utilization proteins (PUPs) to produce metabolites with much higher bioaccessibility to gastrointestinal cells. This study delivered dbPUP as an online database for experimentally characterized PUPs and their homologs in human gut microbiome. This work also performed a systematic classification of PUPs into enzyme classes, families, and subfamilies. The signature Pfam domains were identified for PUP families, enabling conserved domain-based PUP annotation. This standardized sequence similarity-based PUP classification system offered a guideline for the future inclusion of new experimentally characterized PUPs and the creation of new PUP families. An in-depth data analysis was further conducted on PUP homologs and physically linked PUP gene clusters (PGCs) in gut microbiomes of different human populations.",

      "sc:description": "Prediction and collection of protein-metabolite interactions.\n\nPMIDB provides both interactions and non-interactions between protein and metabolite, which not only reduces the experimental cost for biological experimenters, but also facilitates the construction of more accurate algorithms for researchers using machine learning. PMIDB provides a user-friendly interface for browsing the biological function of the metabolites/proteins of interest, experimental technology for identifying PMIs, PMIs in different species, which provides important support for further understanding of cellular processes.\n\nInteractions between proteins and small molecule metabolites play a vital role in regulating protein functions and controlling various cellular processes.",

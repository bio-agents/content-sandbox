                "abstract": "© 2018 The Authors Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The GNAT (General NMR Analysis Agentbox) is a free and open-source software package for processing, visualising, and analysing NMR data. It supersedes the popular DOSY Agentbox, which has a narrower focus on diffusion NMR. Data import of most common formats from the major NMR platforms is supported, as well as a GNAT generic format. Key basic processing of NMR data (e.g., Fourier transformation, baseline correction, and phasing) is catered for within the program, as well as more advanced techniques (e.g., reference deconvolution and pure shift FID reconstruction). Analysis agents include DOSY and SCORE for diffusion data, ROSY T1/T2 estimation for relaxation data, and PARAFAC for multilinear analysis. The GNAT is written for the MATLAB® language and comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface. The standard version is intended to run with a MATLAB installation, but completely free-standing compiled versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux are also freely available.",

However, the complexity of microbiome data characteristics such as excessive zeros, over-dispersion, compositional effect, intrinsically microbial correlations and variable sequencing depths makes the power analysis particularly challenging as the analytical form is usually unavailable. Here, we develop a simulation-based strategy and R package powmic to estimate the empirical statistical power while considering the complexity of data characteristics.",

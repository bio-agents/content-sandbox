However, the complexity of microbial data characteristics, such as excessive zeros, over-dispersion, compositionality, intrinsically microbial correlations and variable sequencing depths, makes the power analysis particularly challenging because the analytical form is usually unavailable. Here, we develop a simulation-based power assessment strategy and R package powmic, which considers the complexity of microbial data characteristics.

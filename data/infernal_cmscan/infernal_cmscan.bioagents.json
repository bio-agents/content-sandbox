Infernal uses CMs to search for new family members in sequence databases and to create potentially large multiple sequence alignments. Version 1.1 of Infernal introduces a new filter pipeline for RNA homology search based on accelerated profile hidden Markov model (HMM) methods and HMM-banded CM alignment methods. This enables ∼100-fold acceleration over the previous version and ∼10 000-fold acceleration over exhaustive non-filtered CM searches. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

EBI Search (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch) provides a full-text search engine across nearly 5 billion entries, while the Job Dispatcher agents framework (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services) enables the scientific community to perform a diverse range of sequence analysis using popular bioinformatics applications. Both allow users to interact through user-friendly web applications, as well as via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs. Here, we describe recent improvements to these services and updates made to accommodate the increasing data requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

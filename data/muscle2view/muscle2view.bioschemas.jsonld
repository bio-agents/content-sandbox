      "sc:description": "CellProfiler pipeline for detection of the capillary-to-muscle fiber interface and high-content quantification of fiber type-specific histology.\n\nBecause manual immunohistochemical analysis of features such as skeletal muscle fiber typing, capillaries, myonuclei, and fiber size-related parameters is time consuming and prone to user subjectivity, automatic computational methods could allow for faster and more objective evaluation. Here, we developed Muscle2View, a free CellProfiler-based pipeline that integrates all key fiber-morphological variables, including the novel quantification of the capillary-to-fiber interface, in one single agent. Provided that the images are of sufficient quality and the settings are configured for the specific study, the pipeline allows for automatic and unsupervised analysis of fiber borders, myonuclei, capillaries, and morphometric parameters in a fiber type-specific manner from large batches of images in <10 min tissue sample.",

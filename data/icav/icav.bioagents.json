                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The Author(s).To date, various studies have found that the occurrence of cancer may be related to viral infections. Therefore, it is important to explore the relationship between viruses and diseases. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has defined six types of viruses as Class 1 human carcinogens, including Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, human herpesvirus 8 and human papillomavirus, while Merkel cell polyomavirus is classified as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' (Group 2A). Therefore, in-depth research on these viruses will help clarify their relationship with diseases, and substantial efforts have been made to sequence their genomes. However, there is no complete database documenting these cancer-associated viruses, and researchers are not able to easily access and retrieve the published genomes. In this study, we developed iCAV, a database that integrates the genomes of cancer-related viruses and the corresponding phenotypes. We collected a total of 18 649 genome sequences from seven human disease-related viruses, and each virus was further classified by the associated disease, sample and country. iCAV is a comprehensive resource of cancer-associated viruses that provides browse and download functions for viral genomes.",

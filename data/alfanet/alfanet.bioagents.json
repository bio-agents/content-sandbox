                "abstract": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Alfalfa has emerged as one of the most important forage crops, owing to its wide adaptation and high biomass production worldwide. In the last decade, the emergence of bacterial stem blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae ALF3) in alfalfa has caused around 50% yield losses in the United States. Studies are being conducted to decipher the roles of the key genes and pathways regulating the disease, but due to the sparse knowledge about the infection mechanisms of Pseudomonas, the development of resistant cultivars is hampered. The database alfaNET is an attempt to assist researchers by providing comprehensive Pseudomonas proteome annotations, as well as a host–pathogen interactome agent, which predicts the interactions between host and pathogen based on orthology. alfaNET is a user‐friendly and efficient agent and includes other features such as subcellular localization annotations of pathogen proteins, gene ontology (GO) annotations, network visualization, and effector protein prediction. Users can also browse and search the database using particular keywords or proteins with a specific length. Additionally, the BLAST search agent enables the user to perform a homology sequence search against the alfalfa and Pseudomonas proteomes. With the successful implementation of these attributes, alfaNET will be a beneficial resource to the research community engaged in implementing molecular strategies to mitigate the disease. alfaNET is freely available for public use at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/alfanet/.",

description: Signal-to-Noise applied to Gene Expression Experiments. Signal-to-noise
  ratios can be used as a proxy for quality of gene expression studies and samples.
  The SNRs can be calculated on any gene expression data set as long as gene IDs are
  available, no access to the raw data files is necessary. This allows to flag problematic
  studies and samples in any public data set.

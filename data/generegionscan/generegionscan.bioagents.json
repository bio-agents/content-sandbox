    "description": "A package with focus on analysis of discrete regions of the genome using Affymetrix data, including additional information about the sequence of each probe and the probe set it is derived from. It includes a number of functions used for plotting these probe level data as a function of location along sequences of mRNA-strands. This can be used for analysis of variable splicing, and is especially well suited for use with exon-array data.",

                "abstract": "Whole-genome microarrays allow us to interrogate the entire transcriptome of a cell. Affymetrix microarrays are constructed using several probes that match to different regions of a gene and a summarization step reduces this complexity into a single value, representing the expression level of the gene or the expression level of an exon in the case of exon arrays. However, this simplification eliminates information that might be useful when focusing on specific genes of interest. To address these limitations, we present a software package for the R platform that allows detailed analysis of expression at the probe level. The package matches the probe sequences against a target gene sequence (either mRNA or DNA) and shows the expression levels of each probe along the gene. It also features functions to fit a linear regression based on several genetic models that enables study of the relationship between gene expression and genotype. Â© 2009 The Author(s).",

      "sc:description": "an open-source GUI for plant image analysis.\n\nPhenoImage â€“ Wheat and Rice Center for Heat Resilience.\n\nPhenoImage is an open-source GUI based cross-platform solution for high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) image processing with the aim to make image analysis accessible to users with either little or no programming skills. The open-source nature provides the possibility to extend its usability to meet user-specific requirements. The availability of multiple functions and filtering parameters provides flexibility to analyze images from a wide variety of plant species and platforms. PhenoImage can be run on a personal computer, as well as on high-performance computing clusters for processing large-scale phenotypic data.",

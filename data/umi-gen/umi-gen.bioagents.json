    "description": "a UMI-based reads simulator for variant calling evaluation in paired-end sequencing NGS libraries.\n\nAbstract Motivation With Next Generation Sequencing becoming more affordable every year, NGS technologies asserted themselves as the fastest and most reliable way to detect Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) in cancer patients. These technologies can be used to sequence DNA at very high depths thus allowing to detect abnormalities in tumor cells with very low frequencies. A lot of different variant callers are publicly available and usually do a good job at calling out variants. However, when frequencies begin to drop under 1%, the specificity of these agents suffers greatly as true variants at very low frequencies can be easily confused with sequencing or PCR artifacts. The recent use of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) in NGS experiments offered a way to accurately separate true variants from artifacts.",

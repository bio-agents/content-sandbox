description: Pscanchip is a web server that, starting from a collection of genomic
  regions derived from a chip-seq experiment, scans them using motif descriptors like
  jaspar or transfac position-specific frequency matrices, or descriptors uploaded
  by users, and it evaluates both motif enrichment and positional bias within the
  regions according to different measures and criteria.

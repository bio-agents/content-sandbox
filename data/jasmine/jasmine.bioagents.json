While many agents exist for investigating isomiR populations, they differ in how they characterize an isomiR, making it difficult to compare results across different agents. Thus, there is a need for a more comprehensive and systematic standard for defining isomiRs. Such a standard would allow investigation of isomiR population structure in progressively more refined sub-populations, permitting the identification of more subtle changes between conditions and leading to an improved understanding of the processes that generate these differences. Results: We developed Jasmine, a software agent that incorporates a hierarchal framework for characterizing isomiR populations. Jasmine is a Java application that can process raw read data in fastq/fasta format, or mapped reads in SAM format to produce a detailed characterization of isomiR populations. Thus, Jasmine can reveal structure not apparent in a standard miRNA-Seq analysis pipeline. Availability and implementation: Jasmine is implemented in Java and R and freely available at bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/bipous/jasmine/src/master/.",

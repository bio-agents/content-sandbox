Using a large training sample where the genotype labels are known, the algorithm will obtain more accurate classification results on new data. It is based on a linear model, uses the Mahalanobis distance for classification. Non-biological variation is removed through normalization. It captures similarities across genotype groups and probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate classification.",

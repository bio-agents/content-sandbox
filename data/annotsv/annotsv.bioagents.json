Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.With the dramatic increase of pangenomic analysis, Human geneticists have generated large amount of genomic data including millions of small variants (SNV/indel) but also thousands of structural variations (SV) mainly from next-generation sequencing and array-based techniques. While the identification of the complete SV repertoire of a patient is getting possible, the interpretation of each SV remains challenging. To help identifying human pathogenic SV, we have developed a web server dedicated to their annotation and ranking (AnnotSV) as well as their visualization and interpretation (knotAnnotSV) freely available at the following address: https://www.lbgi.fr/AnnotSV/. A large amount of annotations from >20 sources is integrated in our web server including among others genes, haploinsufficiency, triplosensitivity, regulatory elements, known pathogenic or benign genomic regions, phenotypic data. An ACMG/ClinGen compliant prioritization module allows the scoring and the ranking of SV into 5 SV classes from pathogenic to benign. Finally, the visualization interface displays the annotated SV in an interactive way including popups, search fields, filtering options, advanced colouring to highlight pathogenic SV and hyperlinks to the UCSC genome browser or other public databases. This web server is designed for diagnostic and research analysis by providing important resources to the user.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary Structural Variations (SV) are a major source of variability in the human genome that shaped its actual structure during evolution. Moreover, many human diseases are caused by SV, highlighting the need to accurately detect those genomic events but also to annotate them and assist their biological interpretation. Therefore, we developed AnnotSV that compiles functionally, regulatory and clinically relevant information and aims at providing annotations useful to (i) interpret SV potential pathogenicity and (ii) filter out SV potential false positive. In particular, AnnotSV reports heterozygous and homozygous counts of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions called within each SV for the analyzed patients, this genomic information being extremely useful to support or question the existence of an SV. We also report the computed allelic frequency relative to overlapping variants from DGV (MacDonald et al., 2014), that is especially powerful to filter out common SV. To delineate the strength of AnnotSV, we annotated the 4751 SV from one sample of the 1000 Genomes Project, integrating the sample information of four million of SNV/indel, in less than 60 s. Availability and implementation AnnotSV is implemented in Tcl and runs in command line on all platforms. The source code is available under the GNU GPL license.

description: Provides several metrics for assessing relative importance in linear
  models. These can be printed, plotted and bootstrapped. The recommended metric is
  lmg, which provides a decomposition of the model explained variance into non-negative
  contributions. There is a version of this package available that additionally provides
  a new and also recommended metric called pmvd. If you are a non-US user, you can
  download this extended version from Ulrike Groempings web site.

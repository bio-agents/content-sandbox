    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'pre-trained', 'generalizable', 'assays', 'Boosting' | Machine Learning in Quality Assessment of Early Stage Next-Generation Sequencing Data | Machine Learning Quality Assessment of NGS Data | seqQscorer is a python implementation that handles quality statistics or report summaries (quality features) as input to calculate a probability of an input sample to be of low quality. This probability is calculated with pre-trained classification models. The quality features are derived from FastQ and BAM files as shown in the Figure below and described in detail in our preprint on bioRxiv",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.Nowadays high-throughput omics technologies are routinely used in biological research. From the omics data, researchers can easily get two gene lists (e.g. stress-induced genes vs. stress-repressed genes) related to their biological question. The next step would be to apply enrichment analysis agents to identify distinct functional/regulatory features between these two gene lists for further investigation. Although various enrichment analysis agents are already available, two challenges remain to be addressed. First, most existing agents are designed to analyze only one gene list, so they cannot directly compare two gene lists. Second, almost all existing agents focus on identifying the enriched qualitative features (e.g. gene ontology [GO] terms, pathways, domains, etc.). Many quantitative features (e.g. number of mRNA isoforms of a gene, mRNA half-life, protein half-life, transcriptional plasticity, translational efficiency, etc.) are available in the yeast, but no existing agents provide analyses on these quantitative features. To address these two challenges, here we present Yeast Quantitative Features Comparator (YQFC) that can directly compare various quantitative features between two yeast gene lists. In YQFC, we comprehensively collected and processed 85 quantitative features from the yeast literature and yeast databases. For each quantitative feature, YQFC provides three statistical tests (t-test, U test and KS test) to test whether this quantitative feature is statistically different between the two input yeast gene lists. The distinct quantitative features identified by YQFC may help researchers to study the underlying molecular mechanisms that differentiate the two input yeast gene lists. We believe that YQFC is a useful agent to expedite the biological research that uses high-throughput omics technologies. Database URL: http://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YQFC/",

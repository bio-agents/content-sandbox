Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.With the proliferating studies of human cancers by single-cell RNA sequencing technique (scRNA-seq), cellular heterogeneity, immune landscape and pathogenesis within diverse cancers have been uncovered successively. The exponential explosion of massive cancer scRNA-seq datasets in the past decade are calling for a burning demand to be integrated and processed for essential investigations in tumor microenvironment of various cancer types. To fill this gap, we developed a database of Cancer Single-cell Expression Map (CancerSCEM, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem), particularly focusing on a variety of human cancers. To date, CancerSCE version 1.0 consists of 208 cancer samples across 28 studies and 20 human cancer types. A series of uniformly and multiscale analyses for each sample were performed, including accurate cell type annotation, functional gene expressions, cell interaction network, survival analysis and etc. Plus, we visualized CancerSCEM as a user-friendly web interface for users to browse, search, online analyze and download all the metadata as well as analytical results. More importantly and unprecedentedly, the newly-constructed comprehensive online analyzing platform in CancerSCEM integrates seven analyze functions, where investigators can interactively perform cancer scRNA-seq analyses. In all, CancerSCEM paves an informative and practical way to facilitate human cancer studies, and also provides insights into clinical therapy assessments.",

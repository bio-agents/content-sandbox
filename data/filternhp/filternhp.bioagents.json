American Journal of Primatology Published by Wiley Periodicals LLCNonhuman primates (NHPs) are widely studied across many scientific disciplines using a variety of techniques in diverse environments. Due to the wide scope of NHP research, substantial overlap in research topics and questions can occur, whose resulting scientific evidence is synthesized by literature reviews. Identifying all relevant research on a particular topic involving NHPs can be difficult and time consuming. By adopting objective search development techniques from systematic reviews, we developed search filters to detect all scientific publications involving NHPs in PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science. We compared the performance of our comprehensive NHP search filters to search strings typical of a novice database user (i.e., NHP simple search strings) and validated their sensitivity by combining these searches with a topic search of cortisol related studies. For all comparisons, our comprehensive NHP search filters retrieved considerably more scientific publications than the NHP simple search strings. Importantly, our comprehensive NHP search filters are easy to use (text can be copied and pasted into the database search engine) and detect the most recent publications that have yet to be indexed by the bibliographic databases queried. Additionally, we developed filterNHP, an R package and web-based application (https://filterNHP.dpz.eu), for researchers interested in literature searches involving a taxonomic sub-group of NHPs. filterNHP alleviates time necessary for adapting our comprehensive NHP search filters for a particular NHP sub-group by automatizing the creation of these search filters. Altogether, our comprehensive NHP search filters and those for taxonomic sub-groups generated by filterNHP will enable swift and easy retrieval of the available scientific literature involving NHPs, and thereby help enhance the quality of new NHP literature reviews that guide future scientific research (new experiments) and public policy (e.g., on welfare and conservation).",

description: This package provides a set of functions to analyse overdispersed counts
  or proportions. Most of the methods are already available elsewhere but are scattered
  in different packages. The proposed functions should be considered as complements
  to more sophisticated methods such as generalized estimating equations (GEE) or
  generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM).

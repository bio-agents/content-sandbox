                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The AuthorsMost cells in multicellular organisms are somehow asymmetric, polarized: maintaining separate membrane domains. Typical examples are the epithelial cells (apical-basal polarization), neurons (dendritic-axonal domains), or migratory cells (with a leading and a trailing edge). Here we present the most comprehensive database containing experimentally verified mammalian proteins that display polarized sorting or secretion, focusing on epithelial polarity. In addition to the source cells or tissues, homology-based inferences and transmembrane topology (if applicable) are all provided. PolarProtDb also offers a detailed interface displaying all information that may be relevant for trafficking: including post-translational modifications (glycosylations and phosphorylations), known or predicted short linear motifs conserved across orthologs, as well as potential interaction partners. Data on polarized sorting has so far been scattered across myriads of publications, hence difficult to access. This information can help researchers in several areas, such as scanning for potential entry points of viral agents like COVID-19. PolarProtDb shall be a useful resource to design future experiments as well as for comparative analyses. The database is available at http://polarprotdb.enzim.hu.",

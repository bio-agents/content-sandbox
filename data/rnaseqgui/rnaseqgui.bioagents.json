                "abstract": "Summary:We present RNASeqGUI R package, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the identification of differentially expressed genes across multiple biological conditions. This R package includes some wellknown RNA-Seq agents, available at www.bioconductor.org. RNASeqGUI package is not just a collection of some known methods and functions, but it is designed to guide the user during the entire analysis process. RNASeqGUI package is mainly addressed to those users who have little experience with command-line software. Therefore, thanks to RNASeqGUI, they can conduct analogous analyses using this simple graphical interface. Moreover, RNASeqGUI is also helpful for those who are expert R-users because it speeds up the usage of the included RNASeq methods drastically. Â© The Author 2014.

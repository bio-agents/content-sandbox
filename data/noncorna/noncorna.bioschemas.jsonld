Here, we developed NoncoRNA which contained 8233 entries between 5568 ncRNAs and 154 drugs in 134 cancers. Each entry in the NoncoRNA contains detailed information on the ncRNAs, drugs, and cancers, the ncRNA expression pattern and experimental detection techniques, drug response and other targets, literature references, and other information",

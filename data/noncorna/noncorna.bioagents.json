Here, we developed NoncoRNA which contained 8233 entries between 5568 ncRNAs and 154 drugs in 134 cancers.

NoncoRNA offers a user-friendly, open access web interface to easily browse, search, and download data. NoncoRNA also provides a submission page for researchers to submit newly validated ncRNA-drug-cancer associations. NoncoRNA might serve as an immeasurable resource for understanding the roles of ncRNAs in cancer therapy.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2022 IEEE.Propensity score matching (PSM) is a technique used in retrospective investigation of cohort matching as an alternative approach to the prospective matching that is typically used by a randomized control trial (RCT). The process of selecting untreated cases that are the best match to the treated cases is the focus of this research. We created a PSM package for the python environment, termed PsmPy, to carry out this task. The PsmPy package debuted and proposed here is based on a logistic regression logit score where a match is selected using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Additional plotting and arguments are available to the user and are also described. To benchmark our method, we compared it with the existing R package, MatchIt, and evaluated our covariates' residual effect sizes with respect to the treatment condition before and after matching. Using a Mann-Whitney statistical test, we showed that our method significantly outperformed MatchIt in cohort matching (U=49, p<0.0001) when comparing residual effect sizes of the covariates. The PsmPy demonstrated a 10-fold average improvement in residual effect sizes amongst covariates when compared with the package MatchIt, suggesting that it is a viable alternative for use in propensity matching studies.",

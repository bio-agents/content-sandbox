    "description": "debCAM is an R package for fully unsupervised deconvolution of complex tissues. It provides basic functions to perform unsupervised deconvolution on mixture expression profiles by Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) and some auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific results. It also implements functions to perform supervised deconvolution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers, S matrix or A matrix. Combining molecular markers from CAM and from prior knowledge can achieve semi-supervised deconvolution of mixtures.",

We develop a fully unsupervised deconvolution method to dissect complex tissues into molecularly distinctive tissue or cell subtypes based on bulk expression profiles. We implement an R package, deconvolution by Convex Analysis of Mixtures (debCAM) that can automatically detect tissue/cell-specific markers, determine the number of constituent subtypes, calculate subtype proportions in individual samples and estimate tissue/cell-specific expression profiles. We demonstrate the performance and biomedical utility of debCAM on gene expression, methylation, proteomics and imaging data. With enhanced data preprocessing and prior knowledge incorporation, debCAM software agent will allow biologists to perform a more comprehensive and unbiased characterization of tissue remodeling in many biomedical contexts.",

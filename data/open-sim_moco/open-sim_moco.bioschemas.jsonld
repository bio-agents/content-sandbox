Using the direct collocation method, Moco can solve a wide range of problems, including motion tracking, motion prediction, and parameter optimization. The design of Moco focuses on ease-of-use, customizability, and extensibility. Just like OpenSim itself, Moco has interfaces in XML/command-line, Matlab, Python, Java, and C++.",

      "sc:description": "In the TXG-MAPr, users can analyze dose- and time-response curves, compound correlation plots and functional annotation of the WGCNA modules to derive mechanistic information of the toxicity. In addition, we included the prediction of transcription factor activities, as well as physical interactions between downstream proteins encoded by the transcriptome, which might be useful in analyzing the perturbations triggered by exposure with toxic compounds. Users can investigate module perturbation of the TG-GATEs compounds by looking at the module eigengene scores (EGS)",

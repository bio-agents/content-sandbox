                "abstract": "Â© 2004-2012 IEEE.Evidence has accumulated enough to prove non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in cellular biological processes and disease pathogenesis. High throughput techniques have produced a large number of ncRNAs whose function remains unknown. Since the accurate identification of ncRNAs family is helpful to the research of their function, it is of necessity and urgency to predict the family of each ncRNAs. Although several traditional excellent methods are applicable to predict the family of ncRNAs, their complex procedures or inaccurate performance remain major problems confronting us. The main idea of those methods is first to predict the secondary structure, and then identify ncRNAs family according to properties of the secondary structure. Unfortunately, the multi-step error superposition, especially the imperfection of RNA secondary structure prediction agents, maybe the cause of low accuracy. In this paper, a novel end-To-end method 'ncRFP' was proposed to complete the prediction task based on Deep Learning. Instead of predicting the secondary structure, ncRFP predicts the ncRNAs family by automatically extracting features from ncRNAs sequences. Compared with other methods, ncRFP not only simplifies the process but also improves accuracy. The source code of ncRFP can be available at https://github.com/linyuwangPHD/ncRFP.",

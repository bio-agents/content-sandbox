      "sc:description": "An open source, freeware agent to simulate river water temperature coupled with HEC-RAS.\n\nThis method paper explains the i-Tree Cool River model algorithms for simulating the response of river water temperature to urban greening. The model captures the warming and cooling impacts of urban development and restoration through a water and energy budget. The water budget includes river inflows from urban storm sewers and reservoirs, and the associated water temperatures. The energy budget adjusts radiation fluxes due to riparian shading and evapotranspiration, and propagates temperature downstream. Restorative cooling of the river can be simulated through algorithms for cool groundwater, either as direct inflows or by river water replacement called hyporheic exchange",

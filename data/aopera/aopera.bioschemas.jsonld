This informational agent is specifically targeted to users with an uncharacterized chemical and limited toxicity information, but can also assist you if you already have information that links your uncharacterized chemical to a molecular initiating event (MIE), a key event (KE), or an adverse outcome (AO), or if you have a characterized chemical",

These hidden inputs can be interpreted as a control that tries to minimize the discrepancies between a given model and taken measurements. The idea is also called the Dynamic Elastic Net, as proposed in the paper \"Learning (from) the errors of a systems biology model\" (Engelhardt, Froelich, Kschischo 2016) <doi:10.1038/srep20772>. To use the experimental SBML import function, the 'rsbml' package is required. For installation I refer to the official 'rsbml' page: <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rsbml.html>.",

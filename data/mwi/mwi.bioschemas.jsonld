      "sc:description": "Myelin Water Fraction and Intra/Extracellular Water Geometric Mean T2 Normative Atlases for the Cervical Spinal Cord from 3T MRI | Normative atlases for the spinal cord using myelin water imaging | Myelin water imaging was applied in 20 healthy spinal cords to create T2 metric healthy population atlases that depict the mean and variation of myelin water fraction (MWF), and intra- and extra-cellular water mobility as described by geometric mean T2 (IEGMT2). The created atlases demonstrated structural variations in the spinal cord consistent with well-known anatomical characteristics. These atlases (in PAM50 space from Spinal Cord agentbox) can be used as a reference to demonstrate areas of abnormalities in individuals with myelin-related disease and damage.

  "sc:description": "A flexible, modular software package intended for the processing of electron microscopy images is presented. The system consists of a set of image processing agents or filters, written in the C programming language, and a command line style user interface based on the UNIX shell. The pipe and filter structure of UNIX and the availability of command files in the form of shell scripts eases the construction of complex image processing procedures from the simpler agents.",

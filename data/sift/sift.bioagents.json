It was first introduced in 2001, with a corresponding website that provides users with predictions on their variants. Since its release, SIFT has become one of the standard agents for characterizing missense variation. We have updated SIFT's genome-wide prediction agent since our last publication in 2009, and added new features to the insertion/deletion (indel) agent. We also show accuracy metrics on independent data sets. The original developers have hosted the SIFT web server at FHCRC, JCVI and the web server is currently located at BII.

Each amino acid substitution potentially affects protein function. We have constructed a agent that uses sequence homology to predict whether a substitution affects protein function. SIFT, which sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions, classifies substitutions as tolerated or deleterious. A higher proportion of substitutions predicted to be deleterious by SIFT gives an affected phenotype than substitutions predicted to be deleterious by substitution scoring matrices in three test cases. Using SIFT before mutagenesis studies could reduce the number of functional assays required and yield a higher proportion of affected phenotypes. SIFT may be used to identify plausible disease candidates among the SNPs that cause missense substitutions.",

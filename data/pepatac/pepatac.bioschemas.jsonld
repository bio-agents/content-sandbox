For more information see: http://pepatac.databio.org/.\n\nPEPATAC is an ATAC-seq pipeline. It trims adapters, maps reads, calls peaks, and creates bigwig tracks, TSS enrichment files, and other outputs. It is optimized on unique features of ATAC-seq data to be fast and accurate and provides several unique analytical approaches.\n\nAn open structure and agentkit for organizing large-scale, sample-intensive biological research projects.\n\nPEP, or Portable Encapsulated Projects, is a community effort to make sample metadata reusable. PEPs decouple metadata from analysis-",

      "sc:description": "Revisiting Data Fidelity and Regularization.\n\nOver four decades, the majority addresses the problem of optical flow estimation using variational methods. With the advance of machine learning, some recent works have attempted to address the problem using convolutional neural network (CNN) and have showed promising results. FlowNet2 [1], the state-of-the-art CNN, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow estimation. LiteFlowNet2 is built on the foundation laid by conventional methods and resembles the corresponding roles as data fidelity and regularization in variational methods. We compute optical flow in a spatial-pyramid formulation as SPyNet [2] but through a novel lightweight cascaded flow inference",

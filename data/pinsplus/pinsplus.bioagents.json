For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Since cancer is a heterogeneous disease, tumor subtyping is crucial for improved treatment and prognosis. We have developed a subtype discovery agent, called PINSPlus, that is: (i) robust against noise and unstable quantitative assays, (ii) able to integrate multiple types of omics data in a single analysis and (iii) dramatically superior to established approaches in identifying known subtypes and novel subgroups with significant survival differences. Our validation on 12,158 samples from 44 datasets shows that PINSPlus vastly outperforms other approaches. The software is easy-to-use and can partition hundreds of patients in a few minutes on a personal computer.",

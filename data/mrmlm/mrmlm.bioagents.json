    "description": "An R Platform for Multi-locus Genome-wide Association Studies.\n\nMulti-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model Agents for Genome-Wide Association Study with Graphical User Interface.\n\nConduct multi-locus genome-wide association study under the framework of multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each marker on the genome is scanned. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for true QTL.

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of ChinaPrevious studies have reported that some important loci are missed in single-locus genome-wide association studies (GWAS), especially because of the large phenotypic error in field experiments. To solve this issue, multi-locus GWAS methods have been recommended. However, only a few software packages for multi-locus GWAS are available. Therefore, we developed an R software named mrMLM v4.0.2. This software integrates mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, pLARmEB, pKWmEB, and ISIS EM-BLASSO methods developed by our lab. There are four components in mrMLM v4.0.2, including dataset input, parameter setting, software running, and result output. The fread function in data.table is used to quickly read datasets, especially big datasets, and the doParallel package is used to conduct parallel computation using multiple CPUs. In addition, the graphical user interface software mrMLM.GUI v4.0.2, built upon Shiny, is also available. To confirm the correctness of the aforementioned programs, all the methods in mrMLM v4.0.2 and three widely-used methods were used to analyze real and simulated datasets. The results confirm the superior performance of mrMLM v4.0.2 to other methods currently available. False positive rates are effectively controlled, albeit with a less stringent significance threshold. mrMLM v4.0.2 is publicly available at BioCode (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/biocode/agents/BT007077) or R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mrMLM.GUI/index.html) as an open-source software.",

We thereby combine a graphical representation of the clustered dataset as a network with the community finding algorithms into one coherent framework. Our approach entails displaying the results of the heuristics to users, providing a setting from which to start the exploration and data analysis. This is considered multilevel because allows the user to have an overview and detailed of the merging of elements into clusters.",

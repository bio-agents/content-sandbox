      "sc:description": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis transposon sequencing database (MtbTnDB) is large-scale guide to genetic conditional essentiality. TnSeq has been used extensively in M. tuberculosis genetic research and identification of gene essentiality (TnSeq) profiles is important for predicting gene function. However, these profiles are buried across dozens of research papers within supplementary materials which makes querying them cumbersome. The MtbTnDB solves this problem by building a central repository of TnSeq screens performed in M. tuberculosis, and allows users easy access to data through an interactive web-app.",

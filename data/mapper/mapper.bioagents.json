In this paper, we present a pipeline based on Mapper, a topological simplification agent, to analyze gene co-expression data. We first validate the method by reproducing key results from the literature on the Allen Human Brain Atlas and the correlations between resting-state fMRI and gene co-expression maps. We then analyze a dopamine-related gene set and find that co-expression networks produced by Mapper return a structure that matches the well-known anatomy of the dopaminergic pathway. Our results suggest that network based descriptions can be a powerful agent to explore the relationships between genetic pathways and their association with brain function and its perturbation due to illness and/or pharmacological challenges.",

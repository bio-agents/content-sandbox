The partitioning algorithm fragments large DNA sequences into smaller, fabricable DNA blocks sharing flanking homologies for in vitro and in vivo DNA assembly. Overlapping homology regions between adjacent DNA blocks are optimized to remove hairpin, sequence repeats and any pattern that interferes with the DNA assembly process. Segments, blocks and sub-blocks that build the blueprint for hierarchical DNA assembly are listed in a GenBank output file.",

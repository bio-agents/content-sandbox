  "sc:description": "GRADitude: a computational agent for Grad-seq data analysis\n\nGrad-seq is a high-throughput profiling approach for the organism-wide detection of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in which molecular complexes are separated in a gradient by shape and size (Smirnov et al., 2016, PNAS). Grad-seq separates native cellular lysates including complexes, according to their molecular weight and shape in a glycerol gradient, independent of charge and sequence. After this fractionation, RNA-seq and MS-analysis of each of the fractions generated allows the reconstruction of the sedimentation profiles of all detectable RNAs and protein in a single experiment. Further analysis can reveal possible interactions between the individual molecules.",

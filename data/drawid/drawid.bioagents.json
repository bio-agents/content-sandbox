                "abstract": "Â© Ilya Kirov et al.An idiogram construction following chromosome measurements is a versatile agent for cytological, cytogenetic and phylogenetic studies. The information on chromosome length, centromere index and position of cytogenetic landmarks along with modern techniques (e.g. genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, banding, chromosome painting) can help to shed light on genome constitution, chromosome rearrangements and evolution. While idiogram construction is a routine task there are only few freely available programs that can perform chromosome measurements and no software for simultaneous measuring of chromosome parameters, chromosomal landmark and FISH signal positions and idiogram construction. To fill this gap, we developed DRAWID (DRAWing IDiogram), java-based cross-platforming program for chromosome analysis and idiogram construction. DRAWID has number of advantages including a user-friendly interactive interface, possibility for simultaneous chromosome and FISH/GISH/banding signal measurement and idiogram drawing as well as number of useful functions facilitating the procedure of chromosome analysis. The output of the program is Microsoft XL table and publish-ready idiogram picture. DRAWID and the manual for its use are freely available on the website at: http://www.drawid.xyz.",

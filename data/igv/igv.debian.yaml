  description: Integrative Genomics Viewer
  long_description: " The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance\
    \ viewer that\n efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing\
    \ a\n smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution.\n\
    \ A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of\n genomic\
    \ studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation\n sequencing\
    \ data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data.\n Although IGV is\
    \ often used to view genomic data from public sources,\n its primary emphasis\
    \ is to support researchers who wish to visualize and\n explore their own data\
    \ sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV\n supports flexible loading\
    \ of local and remote data sets, and is\n optimized to provide high-performance\
    \ data visualization and exploration\n on standard desktop systems.\n"

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The AuthorsProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in numerous biological processes. Many efforts have been undertaken to develop PPI modulators for therapeutic applications; however, to date, most of the peptide binders designed to target PPIs are derived from native binding helices or using the native helix binding site, which has limited the applications of protein-protein interface binding peptide design. Here, we developed a general computational algorithm, HPer (Helix Positioner), that locates single-helix binding sites at protein-protein interfaces based on the structure of protein targets. HPer performed well on known single-helix-mediated PPIs and recaptured the key interactions and hot-spot residues of native helical binders. We also screened non-helical-mediated PPIs in the PDBbind database and identified 17 PPIs that were suitable for helical peptide binding, and the helical binding sites in these PPIs were also predicted for designing novel peptide ligands. The L2 domain of EGFR, which was the top ranked, was selected as an example to show the protocol and results of designing novel helical peptide ligands on the searched binding site. The binding stability of the designed sequences were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations.",

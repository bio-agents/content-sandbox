description: 'PathNet uses topological information present in pathways and differential
  expression levels of genes (obtained from microarray experiment) to identify pathways
  that are 1) significantly enriched and 2) associated with each other in the context
  of differential expression. The algorithm is described in: PathNet: A agent for pathway
  analysis using topological information. Dutta B, Wallqvist A, and Reifman J. Source

(in preparation)), and can be used to reproduce the analyses in that paper, or to extend them to other data sets.\n\nTo run any of the analysis notebooks, you'll need the short-read-tax-assignment project. See the README for installation instructions. For a static version of these notebooks that you can view as a webpage without installing anything, you can view the notebooks on nbviewer",

The software predicts if gene overexpression of an extracellular protein will lead to successful high-level production in Aspergillus niger. The prediction is based on a proteinâ€™s amino acid sequence. One or more protein sequences can be pasted into the the text area (fasta format) or uploaded as a fasta file.",

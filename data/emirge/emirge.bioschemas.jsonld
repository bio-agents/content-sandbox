      "sc:description": "EMIRGE (Expectation-Maximization Iterative Reconstruction of Genes from the Environment)  reconstructs full length ribosomal genes from short read sequencing data. In the process, it also provides estimates of the sequences' abundances. EMIRGE uses a modification of the EM algorithm to iterate between estimating the expected value of the abundance of all SSU sequences present in a sample and estimating the probabilities for each read that a specific sequence generated that read.  At the end of each iteration, those probabilities are used to re-calculate (correct) a consensus sequence for each reference SSU sequence, and the mapping is\nrepeated, followed by the estimations of probabilities. The iterations should usually stop when the reference sequences no longer change from one iteration to the next.  Practically, 40-80 iterations is usually sufficient for many samples. Right now EMIRGE uses Bowtie alignments internally, though in theory a different mapper could be used.",

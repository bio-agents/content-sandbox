    "description": "Applying knowledge-driven mechanistic inference to toxicogenomics | Mechanistic inference of toxicity from gene expression time series and knowledge graphs | Mechanistic inference for toxicology | This repository provide the code for the publication \"Applying knowledge-driven mechanistic inference to toxicogenomics\" (DOI: xxxxxxxxxxxx) and contains the collection of scripts to reproduce the results obtained. Besides the code, this repository provides: | $ git clone git@github.com:ignaciot/MechSpy.git | You can add new mechanisms of your own to MechSpy by editing mechanisms.py. A mock, commented-out \"M12\" mechanism was added to illustrate where would new mechanisms need to go",

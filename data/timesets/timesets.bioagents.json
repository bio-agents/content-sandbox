                "abstract": "Â© 1981-2012 IEEE.TimeSets is a temporal data visualization technique designed to reveal insights into event sets, such as all the events linked to one person or organization. In this article, we describe two TimeSets-based visual analytics agents for intelligence analysis. In the first case, TimeSets is integrated with other visual analytics agents to support open-source intelligence analysis with Twitter data, particularly the challenge of finding the right questions to ask. The second case uses TimeSets in a participatory design process with analysts that aims to meet their requirements of uncertainty analysis involving fake news. Lessons learned are potentially beneficial to other application domains.",

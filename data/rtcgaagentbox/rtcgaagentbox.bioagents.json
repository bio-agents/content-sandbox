Several efforts, such as the Firehose project, make TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web services and data portals, but this information must be managed, downloaded and prepared for subsequent steps. We have developed an open source and extensible R based data client for pre-processed data from the Firehouse, and demonstrate its use with sample case studies. Results show that our RTCGAAgentbox can facilitate data management for researchers interested in working with TCGA data. The RTCGAAgentbox can also be integrated with other analysis pipelines for further data processing.

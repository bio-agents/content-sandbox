    "description": "A Curated ncRNAomics Knowledgebase for Bridging Basic and Clinical Research in Eye Diseases.\n\nNc2Eye, a literature-mined resource of experimentally validated non-coding RNAs in eye diseases.\n\nEye diseases (EDs) represent the disorders affecting visual system, such as retinoblastoma, diabetic retinopathy, etc. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as a large category of functional RNA molecules, have been reported to play a crucial role in EDs. Here, we developed the Nc2Eye database, which contains 7088 experimentally validated ncRNA-ED associations. It covers 4363 ncRNAs involved in 104 kinds of EDs across 8 species through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers. Nc2Eye also gathered 91 high-throughput transcriptome datasets in EDs and normal controls.",

Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving. We believe that Nc2Eye is a timely and valuable knowledgebase for significantly improving and useful for discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.",

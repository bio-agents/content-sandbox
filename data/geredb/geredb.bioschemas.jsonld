GREDB is a publicly available, manually curated biological database depositing the human gene expression regulation relationships (Links). To date, more than 39,000 Links have been contextual-ly annotated through the review of 53,000 plus abstracts. GREDB has the ability to analyze user-supplied gene expression data using the GEREA bioinformatics agent in a causal analysis oriented manner.\n\nThe database can be searched use NCBI official gene symbol (eg. CDC42).\n\nThe new version of GereDB is online for testing, please visit the following link: Run New GereDB online.\n\nHuang, Tinghua & Huang, Xiali & Shi, Bomei & Yao, Min. (2019)",

      "sc:description": "transcriptome-driven efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery.\n\nEstimating efficacy of gene-target-disease associations is a fundamental step in drug discovery. An important data source for this laborious task is RNA expression, which can provide gene-disease associations on the basis of expression fold change and statistical significance. However, the simply use of the log-fold change can lead to numerous false-positive associations. On the other hand, more sophisticated methods that utilize gene co-expression networks do not consider tissue specificity. Here, we introduce Transcriptome-driven Efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery (ThETA), an R package that enables non-expert users to use novel efficacy scoring methods for drug-target discovery. In particular, ThETA allows users to search for gene perturbation (therapeutics) that reverse disease-gene expression and genes that are closely related to disease-genes in tissue-specific networks",

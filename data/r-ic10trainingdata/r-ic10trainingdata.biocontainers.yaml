description: Training datasets for iC10; which implements the classifier described
  in the paper 'Genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer validated
  in over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al., Genome Biology 2014). It uses copy number
  and/or expression form breast cancer data, trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani
  et al.) with the features available and predicts the iC10 group. Genomic annotation
  for the training dataset has been obtained from Mark Dunning's lluminaHumanv3.db
  package.

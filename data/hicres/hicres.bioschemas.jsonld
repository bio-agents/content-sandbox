      "sc:description": "a computational method to estimate and predict the resolution of HiC libraries.\n\nEstimating and predicting HiC library resolution.\n\nThe purpose of this container is to estimate the resolution of your HiC library and to predict the resolution the same library will reach when sequenced at deeper level. There are two main functionality to use HiCRes: you can either start from your analyzed library by providing a bam file containing the valid read pairs and the genome index you used (much faster option) or you can start from your raw sequencing data by providing the 2 fastq files, the enzyme you used, and the species (much slower, limited to human and mouse for now, and MboI, HindIII or Arima digestions).",

  "sc:description": "Regulatory Sequence Analysis Agents (RSAT) is a software suite combining specialised agents for the detection of regulatory signals in non-coding sequences. It includes agents for sequence retrieval, pattern discovery, pattern matching, genome-scale pattern matching, feature-map drawing, random sequence generation and other utilities. Agents may be accessed separately or connected to other agents. As well, the agents are available as web services for integration into programmatic work flows.",

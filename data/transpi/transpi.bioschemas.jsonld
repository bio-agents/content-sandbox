      "sc:description": "TransPi - TRanscriptome ANalysiS PIpeline:  a comprehensive TRanscriptome ANalysiS PIpeline for de novo transcriptome assembly.\n\nTransPi is based on the scientific workflow manager Nextflow. It is designed to help researchers get the best reference transcriptome assembly for their organisms of interest. It performs multiple assemblies with different parameters to then get a non-redundant consensus assembly. It also performs other valuable analyses such as quality assessment of the assembly, BUSCO scores, Transdecoder (ORFs), and gene ontologies (Trinotate), etc. All these with minimum input from the user but without losing the potential of a comprehensive analysis.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Integrated analysis of DNA variants and gene expression profiles may facilitate precise identification of gene regulatory networks involved in disease mechanisms. Despite the widespread availability of public resources, we lack databases that are capable of simultaneously providing gene expression profiles, variant annotations, functional prediction scores and pathogenic analyses. VariED is the first web-based querying system that integrates an annotation database and expression profiles for genetic variants. The database offers a user-friendly platform and locates gene/variant names in the literature by connecting to established online querying agents, biological annotation agents and records from free-text literature. VariED acts as a central hub for organized genome information consisting of gene annotation, variant allele frequency, functional prediction, clinical interpretation and gene expression profiles in three species: human, mouse and zebrafish. VariED also provides a novel scoring scheme to predict the functional impact of a DNA variant. With one single entry, all results regarding queried DNA variants can be downloaded. VariED can potentially serve as an efficient way to obtain comprehensive variant knowledge for clinicians and scientists around the world working on important drug discoveries and precision treatments.",

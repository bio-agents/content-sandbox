It is based on a mitotic clock model where DNA methylation errors occuring during cell-division accrue in the adult stem cell pool of a tissue, allowing tracking of the number of stem-cell divisions. epiTOC2 not only estimates the cumulative number of stem-cell divisions, but also allows the intrinsic rate of stem-cell division per stem-cell per year to be estimated if the chronological age of the sample(s) is known.",

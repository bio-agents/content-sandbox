                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: More and more evidence showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of human sophisticated diseases. Therefore, predicting human lncRNA-disease associations is a challenging and urgently task in bioinformatics to research of human sophisticated diseases. Results: In the work, a global network-based computational framework called as LRWRHLDA were proposed which is a universal network-based method. Firstly, four isomorphic networks include lncRNA similarity network, disease similarity network, gene similarity network and miRNA similarity network were constructed. And then, six heterogeneous networks include known lncRNA-disease, lncRNA-gene, lncRNA-miRNA, disease-gene, disease-miRNA, and gene-miRNA associations network were applied to design a multi-layer network. Finally, the Laplace normalized random walk with restart algorithm in this global network is suggested to predict the relationship between lncRNAs and diseases. Conclusions: The ten-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of LRWRHLDA. As a result, LRWRHLDA achieves an AUC of 0.98402, which is higher than other compared methods. Furthermore, LRWRHLDA can predict isolated disease-related lnRNA (isolated lnRNA related disease). The results for colorectal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach cancer and breast cancer have been verified by other researches. The case studies indicated that our method is effective.",

description: Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of whole transcriptome
  sequencing (RNA-seq) and digital gene expression profiles with biological replication.
  It uses empirical Bayes estimation and exact tests based on the negative binomial
  distribution. It is also useful for differential signal analysis with other types
  of genome-scale count data.

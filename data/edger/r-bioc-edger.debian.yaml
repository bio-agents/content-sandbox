  description: Empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R
  long_description: " Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of\
    \ whole\n transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and digital gene expression\n profiles\
    \ with biological replication. It uses empirical Bayes\n estimation and exact\
    \ tests based on the negative binomial\n distribution. It is also useful for differential\
    \ signal analysis with\n other types of genome-scale count data.\n"

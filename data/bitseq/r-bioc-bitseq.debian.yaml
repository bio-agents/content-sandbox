  description: transcript expression inference and analysis for RNA-seq data
  long_description: " The BitSeq package is targeted for transcript expression\n analysis\
    \ and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data\n in two stage process.\
    \ In the first stage it uses Bayesian\n inference methodology to infer expression\
    \ of individual\n transcripts from individual RNA-seq experiments. The second\n\
    \ stage of BitSeq embraces the differential expression analysis\n of transcript\
    \ expression. Providing expression estimates from\n replicates of multiple conditions,\
    \ Log-Normal model of the\n estimates is used for inferring the condition mean\
    \ transcript\n expression and ranking the transcripts based on the likelihood\n\
    \ of differential expression.\n"

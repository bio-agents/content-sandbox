description: This package is targeted for transcript expression analysis and de analysis
  of rna-seq data in a two-stage process. in the first stage it uses bayesian methodology
  to infer expression of individual transcripts from individual rna-seq experiments.
  the second stage embraces the de analysis of transcript expression by providing
  expression estimates from replicates of multiple conditions.

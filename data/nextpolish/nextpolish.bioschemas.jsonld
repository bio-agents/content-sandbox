      "sc:description": "A fast and efficient genome polishing agent for long read assembly.\n\nFast and accurately polish the genome generated by noisy long reads.\n\nNextPolish is used to fix base errors (SNV/Indel) in the genome generated by noisy long reads, it can be used with short read data only or long read data only or a combination of both. It contains two core modules, and use a stepwise fashion to correct the error bases in reference genome. To correct the raw third-generation sequencing (TGS) long reads with approximately 15-10% sequencing errors, please use NextDenovo",

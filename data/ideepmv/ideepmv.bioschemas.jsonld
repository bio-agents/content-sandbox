      "sc:description": "RNA-binding protein recognition based on multi-view deep feature and multi-label learning.\n\nRNA-binding protein (RBP) is a class of proteins that bind to and accompany RNAs in regulating biological processes. An RBP may have multiple target RNAs, and its aberrant expression can cause multiple diseases. Methods have been designed to predict whether a specific RBP can bind to an RNA and the position of the binding site using binary classification model. However, most of the existing methods do not take into account the binding similarity and correlation between different RBPs. While methods employing multiple labels and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) are proposed to consider binding similarity between different RBPs, the accuracy remains low due to insufficient feature learning and multi-label learning on RNA sequences",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Elsevier LtdShort aggregation prone sequence motifs can trigger aggregation in peptide and protein sequences. Most algorithms developed so far to identify potential aggregation prone regions (APRs) use amino acid residue composition and/or sequence pattern features. In this work, we have investigated the importance of atomic-level characteristics rather than residue level to understand the initiation of aggregation in proteins and peptides. Using atomic-level features an ensemble-classifier, ANuPP has been developed to predict the aggregation-nucleating regions in peptides and proteins. In a dataset of 1279 hexapeptides, ANuPP achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.831 with 77% accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation and an AUC of 0.883 with 83% accuracy in a blind test dataset of 142 hexapeptides. Further, it showed an average SOV of 48.7% on identifying APR regions in 37 proteins. The performance of ANuPP is better than other methods reported in the literature on both amyloidogenic hexapeptide prediction and APR identification. We have developed a web server for ANuPP and it is available at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/ANuPP/. Insights gained from this work demonstrate the importance of atomic and functional group characteristics towards diversity of atomic level origins as well as mechanisms of protein aggregation.",

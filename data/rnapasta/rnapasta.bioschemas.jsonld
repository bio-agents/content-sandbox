It is a java utility intended to work with RNA structural alignments, including the motifs of stem-loops and pseudoknots. It can perform a variety of statistical analyses, and has editing capabilities intended to be useful with alignments that contain variable data such as the presence or absence of stem-loops or pseudoknots across sequences.",

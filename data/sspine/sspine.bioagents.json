                "abstract": "© 2022 by the authors.The heightened dipolar interactions in solids render solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectra more difficult to interpret than solution NMR spectra. On the other hand, ssNMR does not suffer from severe molecular weight limitations like solution NMR. In recent years, ssNMR has undergone rapid technological developments that have enabled structure–function studies of increasingly larger biomolecules, including membrane proteins. Current methodology includes stable isotope labeling schemes, non-uniform sampling with spectral reconstruction, faster magic angle spinning, and innovative pulse sequences that capture different types of interactions among spins. However, computational agents for the analysis of complex ssNMR data from membrane proteins and other challenging protein systems have lagged behind those for solution NMR. Before a structure can be determined, thousands of signals from individual types of multidimensional ssNMR spectra of samples, which may have differing isotopic composition, must be recognized, correlated, categorized, and eventually assigned to atoms in the chemical structure. To address these tedious steps, we have developed an automated algorithm for ssNMR spectra called “ssPINE”. The ssPINE software accepts the sequence of the protein plus peak lists from a variety of ssNMR experiments as inputs and offers automated backbone and side-chain assignments. The alpha version of ssPINE, which we describe here, is freely available through a web submission form.",

description: High throughput sequencing technologies generate large amounts of short
  reads. Mapping these to a reference sequence consumes large amounts of processing
  time and memory, and read mapping errors can lead to noisy or incorrect alignments.
  . SNP-o-matic is a fast, stringent short-read mapping software. It supports a multitude
  of output types and formats, for uses in filtering reads, alignments, sequence-based
  genotyping calls, assisted reassembly of contigs etc.

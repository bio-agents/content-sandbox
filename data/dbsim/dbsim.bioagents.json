Based on our previous research, a two-part software package named DBSim and ELMA is presented. ELMA is used to classify brain tissue into grey matter, white matter, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid and assign electric conductivities accordingly. This data is then used in DBSim to generate patient-specific simulations of the electric field around currently implemented leads Medtronic 3387 and 3389, and Abbott 6180 and 6181. The software is available for free download at https://liu.se/en/article/ne-downloads Clinical Relevance- This is a agent meant for research and educational purposes for e.g. studies on optimal target areas for DBS.",

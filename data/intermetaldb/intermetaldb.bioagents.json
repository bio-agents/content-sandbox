                "abstract": "InterMetalDB is a free-of-charge database and browser of intermolecular metal binding sites that are present on the interfaces of macromolecules forming larger assemblies based on structural information deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). It can be found and freely used at https://intermetaldb.biotech.uni.wroc.pl/. InterMetalDB collects the interfacial binding sites with involvement of metal ions and clusters them on the basis of 50% sequence similarity and the nearest metal environment (5 Ã… radius). The data are available through the web interface where they can be queried, viewed, and downloaded. Complexity of the query depends on the user, because the questions in the query are connected with each other by a logical AND. InterMetalDB offers several useful options for filtering records including searching for structures by particular parameters such as structure resolution, structure description, and date of deposition. Records can be filtered by coordinated metal ion, number of bound amino acid residues, coordination sphere, and other features. InterMetalDB is regularly updated and will continue to be regularly updated with new content in the future. InterMetalDB is a useful agent for all researchers interested in metalloproteins, protein engineering, and metal-driven oligomerization.",

                "abstract": "Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.The plethora of RNA-seq data which have been generated in the recent years constitutes an attractive resource to investigate HLA variation and its relationship with normal and disease phenotypes, such as cancer. However, next generation sequencing (NGS) brings new challenges to HLA analysis because of the mapping bias introduced by aligning short reads originated from polymorphic genes to a single reference genome. Here we describe HLApers, a pipeline which adapts widely used agents for analysis of standard RNA-seq data to infer HLA genotypes and estimate expression. By generating reliable expression estimates for each HLA allele that an individual carries, HLApers allows a better understanding of the relationship between HLA alleles and phenotypes manifested by an individual.",

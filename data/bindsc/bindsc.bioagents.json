    "description": "bindSC (Bi-order INtegration of multi-omics Data from Single Cell sequencing technologies) is an R package for single cell multi-omic integration analysis. bindSC is developed to address the challenge of single-cell multi-omic data integration that consists of unpaired cells measured with unmatched features across modalities. Previous methods such as Seurat, Liger, Harmony did not work on this case unless match feature empricallcy. For example, integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data requires to calculate the gene/promoter activity by counting peaks in gene body, which always loses information. This strategy also did not work on integrating scRNA-seq and cytof data becasue gene expression and protein abundance level is not always correlated due to sparsity of scRNA-seq data or post translational modification.",

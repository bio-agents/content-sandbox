      "sc:description": "ASDmiR is a step-wise method to uncover miRNA regulation related to autism spectrum disorder. MiRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in nervous system developmental, and have potential to cause ASD. However, the miRNA regulation mechanism in ASD is largely unclear. In this work, we present a novel framework, ASDmiR, to identify miRNA-target networks and modules, miRNA sponge networks and modules for uncovering the pathogenesis of ASD, as well as conduct enrichment analysis.",

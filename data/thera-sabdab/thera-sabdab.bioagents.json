Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Therapeutic Structural Antibody Database (Thera-SAbDab; http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/therasabdab) tracks all antibody- A nd nanobody-related therapeutics recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and identifies any corresponding structures in the Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab) with near-exact or exact variable domain sequence matches. Thera-SAbDab is synchronized with SAbDab to update weekly, reflecting new Protein Data Bank entries and the availability of new sequence data published by the WHO. Each therapeutic summary page lists structural coverage (with links to the appropriate SAbDab entries), alignments showing where any near-matches deviate in sequence, and accompanying metadata, such as intended target and investigated conditions. Thera-SAbDab can be queried by therapeutic name, by a combination of metadata, or by variable domain sequence-returning all therapeutics that are within a specified sequence identity over a specified region of the query. The sequences of all therapeutics listed in Thera-SAbDab (461 unique molecules, as of 5 August 2019) are downloadable as a single file with accompanying metadata.",

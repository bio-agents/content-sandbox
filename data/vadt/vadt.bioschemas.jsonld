      "sc:description": "Investigation of allele specific expression in various tissues of broiler chickens using the detection agent VADT.\n\nCurrently the program is in beta-phase and a manuscript drafted for submission. Please feel free to use, but please cite the github for the time period until it is published.\n\nVADT performs various filtering steps of a VCF file before testing for ASE. The first filter performed is removing all variants that have been flagged as failing (FILTER column). Specifically the program looks for a \"PASS\" in the filter column to include that variant in further analysis. VADT removes all variants within a certain distance of an indel defined by the user. VADT also removes all variants with multiple reference and alternative alleles and variants with less than the minimum quality score defined by user.",

      "sc:description": "Bacting is an open-source platform for chemo- and bioinformatics based on Bioclipse that defines a number of common domain objects and wraps common functionality, providing a agentkit independent, scriptable solution to handle data from the life sciences. Like Bioclipse, Bacting is written in the Java language, making use in Java-derived languages like Groovy easy, but also accessible to Python. Deposition of the Bacting package on Maven Central allows it to be easily used in Groovy scripts with @Grab instructions.",

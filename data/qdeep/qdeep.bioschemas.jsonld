      "sc:description": "distance-based protein model quality estimation by residue-level ensemble error classifications using stacked deep residual neural networks.\n\nProtein model quality estimation, in many ways, informs protein structure prediction. Despite their tight coupling, existing model quality estimation methods do not leverage inter-residue distance information or the latest technological breakthrough in deep learning that has recently revolutionized protein structure prediction. Results We present a new distance-based single-model quality estimation method called QDeep by harnessing the power of stacked deep residual neural networks (ResNets). Our method first employs stacked deep ResNets to perform residue-level ensemble error classifications at multiple predefined error thresholds and then combines the predictions from the individual error classifiers for estimating the quality of a protein structural model",

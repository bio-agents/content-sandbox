description: Agentset for the exploration of genetic and genomic data. Adegenet provides
  formal (S4) classes for storing and handling various genetic data, including genetic
  markers with varying ploidy and hierarchical population structure ('genind' class),
  alleles counts by populations ('genpop'), and genome-wide SNP data ('genlight').
  It also implements original multivariate methods (DAPC, sPCA), graphics, statistical
  tests, simulation agents, distance and similarity measures, and several spatial methods.
  A range of both empirical and simulated datasets is also provided to illustrate
  various methods.

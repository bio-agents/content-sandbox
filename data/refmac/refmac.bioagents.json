                "abstract": "This paper describes various components of the macromolecular crystallographic refinement program REFMAC5, which is distributed as part of the CCP4 suite. REFMAC5 utilizes different likelihood functions depending on the diffraction data employed (amplitudes or intensities), the presence of twinning and the availability of SAD/SIRAS experimental diffraction data. To ensure chemical and structural integrity of the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4 Å can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement agents such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, 'jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of anisotropic ADPs. Refinement in the presence of twinning is performed in a fully automated fashion. REFMAC5 is a flexible and highly optimized refinement package that is ideally suited for refinement across the entire resolution spectrum encountered in macromolecular crystallography.",

The likelihood function for macromolecular structures is extended to include prior phase information and experimental standard uncertainties. The assumption that different pans of a structure might have different errors is considered. A method for estimating σ(A) using 'free' reflections is described and its effects analysed. The derived equations have been implemented in the program REFMAC. This has been tested on several proteins at different stages of refinement (bacterial α-amylase, cytochrome c', cross-linked insulin and oligopeptide binding protein). The results derived using the maximum-likelihood residual are consistently better than those obtained from least-squares refinement.",

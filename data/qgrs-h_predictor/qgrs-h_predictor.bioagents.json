                "abstract": "Naturally occurring G-quadruplex structural motifs, formed by guanine-rich nucleic acids, have been reported in telomeric, promoter and transcribed regions of mammalian genomes. G-quadruplex structures have received significant attention because of growing evidence for their role in important biological processes, human disease and as therapeutic targets. Lately, there has been much interest in the potential roles of RNA G-quadruplexes as cis-regulatory elements of post-transcriptional gene expression. Large-scale computational genomics studies on G-quadruplexes have difficulty validating their predictions without laborious testing in 'wet' labs. We have developed a bioinformatics agent, QGRS-H Predictor that can map and analyze conserved putative Quadruplex forming 'G'-Rich Sequences (QGRS) in mRNAs, ncRNAs and other nucleotide sequences, e.g. promoter, telomeric and gene flanking regions. Identifying conserved regulatory motifs helps validate computations and enhances accuracy of predictions. The QGRS-H Predictor is particularly useful for mapping homologous G-quadruplex forming sequences as cis-regulatory elements in the context of 5′-and 3′-untranslated regions, and CDS sections of aligned mRNA sequences. QGRS-H Predictor features highly interactive graphic representation of the data. It is a unique and user-friendly application that provides many options for defining and studying G-quadruplexes. The QGRS-H Predictor can be freely accessed at: http://quadruplex.ramapo.edu/qgrs/app/start. © 2012 The Author(s).",

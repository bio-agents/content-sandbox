Targeting scientists, FastTrack focuses on easy and fast objects tracking from video recordings. With easy installation, intuitive interface FastTrack is the agent of choice for every scientist.\n\nFastTrack is a desktop tracking software, easy to install, easy to use, and performant. The software can be downloaded and modified to adapt to any needs. The core of the software can also be embedded easily in any C++/Qt project.\n\nTracking objects in video recording can be tedious. Existing software are expensive, the learning curve can be steep, and the workflow can not be easily adapted when the project evolved.",

description: Filtering of lowly expressed features (e.g. genes) is a common step before
  performing statistical analysis, but an arbitrary threshold is generally chosen.
  SeqGate implements a method that rationalize this step by the analysis of the distibution
  of counts in replicate samples. The gate is the threshold above which sequenced
  features can be considered as confidently quantified.

description: "It is a high-precision localization prediction method for bacterial\
  \ proteins. it has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular localization\
  \ (scl) predictor. \_psortb version improved recall, higher proteome-scale prediction\
  \ coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. it is the first scl predictor\
  \ specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with atypical\
  \ membrane/cell wall topologies."

Currently, RNAactDrug contains more than 4924200 RNA molecules-drug sensitivity associations at multidimensional molecular levels covering more than 19770 mRNAs, 11119 lncRNAs, 438 miRNAs and 4155 drugs. RNAactDrug aims to help make use of the full breadth and depth of existing large-scale pharmacogenomic data by making this knowledge accessible to both basic researchers",

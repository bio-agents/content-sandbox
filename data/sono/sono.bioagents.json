                "abstract": "© Polish Ultrasound Society.Introduction: A professional and valid ultrasound examination is dependent upon an extensively experienced examiner. Recognition and classification of rare or minimally distinctive findings are a particular source of uncertainty on the part of the examiner. By creating an online-based video database of sonographic findings, we tried to share our own experience for clinical and educational purposes. Material and methods: More than a thousand video clips of documented ultrasound findings were anonymized and cut to a practicable length of between 10 and 25 sec. The findings were critically evaluated and labeled with a primary diagnosis. They were also classified by organ systems and various keywords. Results: An online portal that currently contains more than 1,000 video sequences of typical, non-typical, especially vivid or rare ultrasound findings has been created. The portal is free of charge and accessible for any Internet-capable PC. It is also optimized for use on mobile devices (smartphones, iPads, etc.). Search and location of relevant findings is performed using keywords or a diagnosis-based search function. The Internet address is www.sono.gallery. Conclusions: The video portal is a fast and universally accessible non-commercial platform. Its moving images can be used as an aid in resolving problematic differential diagnoses of typical, non-typical or especially rare ultrasound findings or in verifying one‘s own findings.",

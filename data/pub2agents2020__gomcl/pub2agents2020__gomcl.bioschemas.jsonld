      "sc:description": "A agentkit to cluster, evaluate, and extract non-redundant associations of Gene Ontology-based functions.\n\nGOMCL is a agent to cluster and extract summarized associations of Gene Ontology based functions in omics data. It clusters GO terms using MCL based on overlapping ratios, OC (Overlap coefficient) or JC (Jaccard coefficient). The resulting clusters can be further analyzed and separated into sub-clusters using a second script, GOMCL-sub. This agent helps researchers to reduce time spent on manual curation of large lists of GO terms and minimize biases introduced by shared GO terms in data interpretation.",

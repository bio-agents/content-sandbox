It takes as input raw timelapse images and produces as output cell objects containing information such as elongation rate, birth size, etc. There is support for fluorescent planes.\n\nSegmentation and tracking software for mother machine experiments.\n\nThe name Piazza comes from the Italian word for plaza--a common city square where people can come together to share knowledge and ideas. We strive to recreate that communal atmosphere among students and instructors",

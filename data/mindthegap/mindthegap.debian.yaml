  description: performs detection and assembly of DNA insertion variants in NGS read
    datasets
  long_description: " Designed to call insertions of any size, whether they are novel\
    \ or\n duplicated, homozygous or heterozygous in the donor genome. It takes as\n\
    \ input a set of reads and a reference genome. It outputs two sets of\n FASTA\
    \ sequences: one is the set of breakpoints of detection insertion\n sites, the\
    \ other is the set of assembled insertions for each\n breakpoint. MindTheGap can\
    \ also be used as a genome assembly finishing\n agent. It can fill the gaps between\
    \ a set of input contigs without any a\n priori on their relative order and orientation.\
    \ It outputs the results\n in gfa file.\n"

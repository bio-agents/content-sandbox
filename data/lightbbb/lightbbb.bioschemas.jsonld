      "sc:description": "Computational prediction model of blood-brain-barrier penetration based on LightGBM.\n\nIdentification of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of a compound is a major challenge in neurotherapeutic drug discovery. Conventional approaches for BBB permeability measurement are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. BBB permeability is associated with diverse chemical properties of compounds. However, BBB permeability prediction models have been developed using small datasets and limited features, which are usually not practical due to their low coverage of chemical diversity of compounds.",

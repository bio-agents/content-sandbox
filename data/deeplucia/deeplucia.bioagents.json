                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s).Motivation: The importance of chromatin loops in gene regulation is broadly accepted. There are mainly two approaches to predict chromatin loops: transcription factor (TF) binding-dependent approach and genomic variation-based approach. However, neither of these approaches provides an adequate understanding of gene regulation in human tissues. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning-based chromatin loop prediction model called Deep Learning-based Universal Chromatin Interaction Annotator (DeepLUCIA). Results: Although DeepLUCIA does not use TF binding profile data which previous TF binding-dependent methods critically rely on, its prediction accuracies are comparable to those of the previous TF binding-dependent methods. More importantly, DeepLUCIA enables the tissue-specific chromatin loop predictions from tissue-specific epigenomes that cannot be handled by genomic variation-based approach. We demonstrated the utility of the DeepLUCIA by predicting several novel target genes of SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies targeting Brugada syndrome, COVID-19 severity and age-related macular degeneration.",

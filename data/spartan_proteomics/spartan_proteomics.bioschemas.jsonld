      "sc:description": "SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network) provides a mechanistically inspired approach for integrating cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data with regulatory genomics resources, representing a significant advance in the modeling of cell-specific signaling and gene regulatory programs. The cell surface phenotype is well-known to immunologists through flow cytometry but signaling downstream of cell surface receptors/co-receptors drives transcriptional and chromatin state changes. It is important to connect the “cell surface phenotype” to downstream transcriptional programs and resulting transcriptomic phenotypes. SPaRTAN models this flow of information with single cell resolution.",

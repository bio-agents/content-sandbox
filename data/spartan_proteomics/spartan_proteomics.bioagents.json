    "description": "SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network) provides a mechanistically inspired approach for integrating cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data with regulatory genomics resources, representing a significant advance in the modeling of cell-specific signaling and gene regulatory programs. The cell surface phenotype is well-known to immunologists through flow cytometry but signaling downstream of cell surface receptors/co-receptors drives transcriptional and chromatin state changes. It is important to connect the “cell surface phenotype” to downstream transcriptional programs and resulting transcriptomic phenotypes. SPaRTAN models this flow of information with single cell resolution.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The identity and functions of specialized cell types are dependent on the complex interplay between signaling and transcriptional networks. Recently single-cell technologies have been developed that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of cell-surface receptor expression with transcriptional states. To date, these datasets have not been used to systematically develop cell-context-specific maps of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulators orchestrating cellular identity and function. We present SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network), a computational method to link cell-surface receptors to transcription factors (TFs) by exploiting cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) datasets with cis-regulatory information. SPaRTAN is applied to immune cell types in the blood to predict the coupling of signaling receptors with cell context-specific TFs. Selected predictions are validated by prior knowledge and flow cytometry analyses. SPaRTAN is then used to predict the signaling coupled TF states of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in malignant peritoneal and pleural mesotheliomas. SPaRTAN enhances the utility of CITE-seq datasets to uncover TF and cell-surface receptor relationships in diverse cellular states.",

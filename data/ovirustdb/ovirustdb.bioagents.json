                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.One of the emerging technologies to fight against cancer is oncolytic virus-based immunotherapy. Recently, the FDA approved an oncolytic virus T-vec for the treatment of melanoma. To facilitate the scientific community, we build a manually-curated repository of oncolytic viruses called OvirusTdb (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ovirustdb/). The repository maintains comprehensive information on therapeutically important oncolytic viruses with 5927 records where each record has 25 fields such as the virus species, cancer cell line, synergism with anti-cancer drugs, and many more. It stores information on 09 types of DNA, 15 types of RNA; 300 recombinant and 09 wild-type viral strains; tested against 124 cancer types and 427 cancer cell lines. Approximately, 1047 records suggest improved anti-cancer response using the combinatorial approach with chemotherapeutic agents. Nearly, 3243 and 1506 records indicate cancer cell death via apoptosis induction and immune activation, respectively. OvirusTdb may facilitate researchers in designing and discovering new oncolytic viruses for effective cancer treatment.",

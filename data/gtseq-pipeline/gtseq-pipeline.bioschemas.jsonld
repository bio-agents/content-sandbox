      "sc:description": "Genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) of non-invasive fecal and degraded samples. Genetic monitoring using non-invasive samples provides a complement or alternative to traditional population monitoring methods. However, Next Generation Sequencing approaches to monitoring typically require high quality DNA and the use of non-invasive samples (e.g. scat) is often challenged by poor DNA quality and contamination by non-target species. One promising solution is a highly multiplexed sequencing approach called Genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq), which can enable cost-efficient genomics-based monitoring for populations based on non-invasively collected samples. Here, we develop and validate a GT-seq panel of 324 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) optimized for genotyping of polar bears based on DNA from non-invasively collected fecal samples",

                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2021 Li, Jing, Yan, Liu, Sun, Zhu, Wang, Hao and Xue.The human gastrointestinal tract represents a symbiotic bioreactor that can mediate the interaction of the human host. The deployment and integration of multi-omics technologies have depicted a more complete image of the functions performed by microbial organisms. In addition, a large amount of data has been generated in a short time. However, researchers struggling to keep track of these mountains of information need a way to conveniently gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between microbiota and human diseases. To tackle this issue, we developed Amadis (http://gift2disease.net/GIFTED), a manually curated database that provides experimentally supported microbiota-disease associations and a dynamic network construction method. The current version of the Amadis database documents 20167 associations between 221 human diseases and 774 gut microbes across 17 species, curated from more than 1000 articles. By using the curated data, users can freely select and combine modules to obtain a specific microbe-based human disease network. Additionally, Amadis provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading. We hope it can serve as a useful and valuable resource for researchers exploring the associations between gastrointestinal microbiota and human diseases.",

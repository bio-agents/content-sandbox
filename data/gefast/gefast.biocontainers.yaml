description: Clustering agent primarily designed for processing nucleotide sequences
  obtained from high-throughput sequencing. GeFaST (Generalised Fastidious Swarming
  Agent) picks up the two-phased, iterative clustering strategy of Swarm and generalises
  resp. extends both the clustering and the refinement phase. GeFaST considers the
  iterative strategy as an abstract scheme, which can be coupled with different notions
  of distance. The refinement phase has been generalised by broadening the applicability
  of the original fastidious approach and introducing further refinement methods.

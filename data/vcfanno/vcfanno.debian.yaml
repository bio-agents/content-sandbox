  description: annotate a VCF with other VCFs/BEDs/tabixed files
  long_description: " Vcfanno allows you to quickly annotate your VCF with any number\
    \ of INFO\n fields from any number of VCFs or BED files. It uses a simple conf\
    \ file\n to allow the user to specify the source annotation files and fields and\n\
    \ how they will be added to the info of the query VCF.\n .\n   * For VCF, values\
    \ are pulled by name from the INFO field with special\n     cases of ID and FILTER\
    \ to pull from those VCF columns.\n   * For BED, values are pulled from (1-based)\
    \ column number.\n   * For BAM, depth (count), \"mapq\" and \"seq\" are currently\
    \ supported.\n .\n Vcfanno is written in go and it supports custom user-scripts\
    \ written in\n Lua. It can annotate more than 8000 variants per second with 34\n\
    \ annotations from 9 files on a modest laptop and over 30K variants per\n second\
    \ using 12 processes on a server.\n"

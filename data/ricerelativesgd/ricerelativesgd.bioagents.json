                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Its relatives, including phylogenetically related species of rice and paddy weeds with a similar ecological niche, can provide crucial genetic resources (such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and high photosynthetic efficiency) for rice research. Although many rice genomic databases have been constructed, a database providing large-scale curated genomic data from rice relatives and offering specific gene resources is still lacking. Here, we present RiceRelativesGD, a user-friendly genomic database of rice relatives. RiceRelativesGD integrates large-scale genomic resources from 2 cultivated rice and 11 rice relatives, including 208 321 specific genes and 13 643 genes related to photosynthesis and responsive to external stimuli. Diverse bioinformatics agents are embedded in the database, which allow users to search, visualize and download the information of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first genomic database providing a centralized genetic resource of rice relatives. RiceRelativesGD will serve as a significant and comprehensive knowledgebase for the rice community.",

description: R package dedicated to the differential analysis of rna-seq data. it
  provides agents to generate descriptive and diagnostic graphs, to run the differential
  analysis with one of the well known deseq2 or edger packages and to export the results
  into easily readable tab-delimited files. it also facilitates the generation of
  a html report which displays all the figures produced, explains the statistical
  methods and gives the results of the differential analysis.

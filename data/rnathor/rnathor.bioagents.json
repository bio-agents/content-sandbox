For decades, these structures have been determined and modeled with strong support from computational methods. Still, the accuracy of the latter ones depends on the availability of experimental data, for example, chemical probing information that can define pseudo-energy constraints for RNA folding algorithms. At the same time, diverse computational agents have been developed to facilitate analysis and visualization of data from RNA structure probing experiments followed by capillary electrophoresis or next-generation sequencing. RNAthor, a new software agent for the fully automated normalization of SHAPE and DMS probing data resolved by capillary electrophoresis, has recently joined this collection. RNAthor automatically identifies unreliable probing data. It normalizes the reactivity information to a uniform scale and uses it in the RNA secondary structure prediction. Our web server also provides agents for fast and easy RNA probing data visualization and statistical analysis that facilitates the comparison of multiple data sets.

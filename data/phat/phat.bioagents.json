For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: The Pathogen-Host Analysis Agent (PHAT) is an application for processing and analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data as it relates to relationships between pathogens and their hosts. Unlike custom scripts and tedious pipeline programming, PHAT provides an integrative platform encompassing raw and aligned sequence and reference file input, quality control (QC) reporting, alignment and variant calling, linear and circular alignment viewing, and graphical and tabular output. This novel agent aims to be user-friendly for life scientists studying diverse pathogen-host relationships. Availability and implementation: The project is available on GitHub (https://github.com/chgibb/PHAT) and includes convenient installers, as well as portable and source versions, for both Windows and Linux (Debian and RedHat). Up-to-date documentation for PHAT, including user guides and development notes, can be found at https://chgibb.github.io/PHATDocs/. We encourage users and developers to provide feedback (error reporting, suggestions and comments).",

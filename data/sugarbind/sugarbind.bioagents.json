Information is collected from articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Help files guide the user through the search process and provide a review of structures and names of sugars that appear in human oligosaccharides. Glycans are written in the condensed form of the carbohydrate nomenclature system developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Since its online publication by The MITRE Corporation in 2005, the database has served as a resource for research on the glycobiology of infectious disease. SugarBindDB is currently hosted by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics on the ExPASy server and will be enhanced and linked to related resources as part of the wider UniCarbKB initiative. Enhancements will include the option to display glycans in a variety of formats, including modified 2D condensed IUPAC and symbolic nomenclature. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

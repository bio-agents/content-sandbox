                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2019.Motivation: A central aim of molecular biology is to identify mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Transcription factors (TFs), which are DNA-binding proteins, are highly involved in these processes, thus a crucial information is to know where TFs interact with DNA and to be aware of the TFs’ DNA-binding motifs. For that reason, computational agents exist that link DNA-binding motifs to TFs either without sequence information or based on TF-associated sequences, e.g. identified via a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a novel method to improve the performance of existing agents that link motifs to TFs relying on TF-associated sequences. MASSIF is based on the idea that a DNA-binding motif, which is correctly linked to a TF, should be assigned to a DNA-binding domain (DBD) similar to that of the mapped TF. Because DNA-binding motifs are in general not linked to DBDs, it is not possible to compare the DBD of a TF and the motif directly. Instead we created a DBD collection, which consist of TFs with a known DBD and an associated motif. This collection enables us to evaluate how likely it is that a linked motif and a TF of interest are associated to the same DBD. We named this similarity measure domain score, and represent it as a P-value. We developed two different ways to improve the performance of existing agents that link motifs to TFs based on TF-associated sequences: (i) using meta-analysis to combine P-values from one or several of these agents with the P-value of the domain score and (ii) filter unlikely motifs based on the domain score. Results: We demonstrate the functionality of MASSIF on several human ChIP-seq datasets, using either motifs from the HOCOMOCO database or de novo identified ones as input motifs. In addition, we show that both variants of our method improve the performance of agents that link motifs to TFs based on TF-associated sequences significantly independent of the considered DBD type.",

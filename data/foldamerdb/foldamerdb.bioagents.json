                "abstract": "Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Foldamers are non-natural oligomers that mimic the structural behaviour of natural peptides, proteins and nucleotides by folding into a well-defined 3D conformation in solution. Since their first description about two decades ago, numerous studies have been undertaken dealing with the design, synthesis, characterization and application of foldamers. They have huge application potential as antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-HIV agents and in materials science. Despite their importance, there is no publicly available web resource providing comprehensive information on these compounds. Here we describe FoldamerDB, an open-source, fully annotated and manually curated database of peptidic foldamers. FoldamerDB holds the information about the sequence, structure and biological activities of the foldamer entries. It contains the information on over 1319 species and 1018 activities, collected from more than 160 research papers. The web-interface is designed to be clutter-free, user-friendly and it is compatible with devices of different screen sizes. The interface allows the user to search the database, browse and filter the foldamers using multiple criteria. It also offers a detailed help page to assist new users. FoldamerDB is hoped to bridge the gap in the freely available web-based resources on foldamers and will be of interest to diverse groups of scientists from chemists to biologists. The database can be accessed at http://foldamerdb.ttk.hu/.",

The conventional method of identification by the 16S rDNA gene or other marker gene comparison is not accurate, because it uses a tiny part of the genomic information. The average nucleotide identity calculated between two whole bacterial genomes was proven to be consistent with DNA–DNA hybridization and adopted as the gold standard of bacterial species delineation. Furthermore, there are more bacterial genomes available in public databases recently. All of those contribute to a genome era of bacterial species identification. However, wrongly labeled and low-quality bacterial genome assemblies, especially from type strains, greatly affect accurate identification. In this study, we employed a multi-step strategy to create a type-strain genome database, by removing the wrongly labeled and low-quality genome assemblies. Based on the curated database, a fast bacterial genome identification platform (fIDBAC) was developed (http://fbac.dmicrobe.cn/). The fIDBAC is aimed to provide a single, coherent, and automated workflow for species identification, strain typing, and downstream analysis, such as CDS prediction, drug resistance genes, virulence gene annotation, and phylogenetic analysis.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Accurate inference of the relationship between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and drug resistance is essential for understanding the complicated mechanisms of drug actions and clinical treatment. Traditional biological experiments are time-consuming, laborious, and minor in scale. Although several databases provide relevant resources, computational method for predicting this type of association has not yet been developed. In this paper, we leverage the verified association data of ncRNA and drug resistance to construct a bipartite graph and then develop a linear residual graph convolution approach for predicting associations between non-coding RNA and drug resistance (LRGCPND) without introducing or defining additional data. LRGCPND first aggregates the potential features of neighboring nodes per graph convolutional layer. Next, we transform the information between layers through a linear function. Eventually, LRGCPND unites the embedding representations of each layer to complete the prediction. Results of comparison experiments demon-strate that LRGCPND has more reliable performance than seven other state-of-the-art approaches with an average AUC value of 0.8987. Case studies illustrate that LRGCPND is an effective agent for inferring the associations between ncRNA and drug resistance.",

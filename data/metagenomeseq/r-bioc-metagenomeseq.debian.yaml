  description: GNU R statistical analysis for sparse high-throughput sequencing
  long_description: " MetagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational\n\
    \ Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant\n between\
    \ two or more groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is\n designed to address\
    \ the effects of both normalization and under-sampling\n of microbial communities\
    \ on disease association detection and the\n testing of feature correlations.\n"

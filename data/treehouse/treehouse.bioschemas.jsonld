      "sc:description": "a user-friendly application to obtain subtrees from large phylogenies | Phylogenies are rapidly becoming larger due to the rising number of available genomes. Beyond broad patterns, large phylogenies often become uninterpretable as tip labels are so small or excluded altogether. As a result, large phylogenies can be difficult to use for other researchers especially for groups interested in the relationships among a subset of taxa. Here, we introduce treehouse, a user friendly shiny app that allows researchers to obtain subtrees from large-scale phylogenies. Treehouse is populated with a handful of large-scale phylogenies available through treehouseDB. Additionally, treehouse features an additional function, userTree, which allows a user to upload and parse their own phylogeny | Our aim is to make phylogenies more accessible to all and facilitate researchers exploration in their own phylogenies",

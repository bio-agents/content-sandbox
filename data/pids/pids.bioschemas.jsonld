      "sc:description": "A User-Friendly Plant DNA Fingerprint Database Management System.\n\nThe high variability and somatic stability of DNA fingerprints can be used to identify individuals, which is of great value in plant breeding. DNA fingerprint databases are essential and important agents for plant molecular research because they provide powerful technical and information support for crop breeding, variety quality control, variety right protection, and molecular marker-assisted breeding. Building a DNA fingerprint database involves the production of large amounts of heterogeneous data for which storage, analysis, and retrieval are time and resource consuming. To process the large amounts of data generated by laboratories and conduct quality control, a database management system is urgently needed to track samples and analyze data\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",

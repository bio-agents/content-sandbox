PopInf is incorporated into the workflow system snakemake. All necessary files and scripts are in this directory. There are instructions on preparing the reference panel in a folder called \"Reference_Panel\". There are also instructions on preparing the unknown samples in a folder called \"Unknown_Samples\"",

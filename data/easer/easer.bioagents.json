Thus, obtaining and preparing an appropriate sequence dataset is a crucial first step for all types of genomic analyses. Here, we present a script that can widely facilitate the easy, fast, and effortless downloading and preparation of a proper biological sequence data-set for various genomics studies. This script retrieves Ensembl defined genomic features, associated with a given Ensembl identifier. Coding (CDS) and genomic sequences can be easily retrieved based on a selected relationship from a set of relationship types, either considering all available organisms or a user specified subset of organisms. The script is very user-friendly and by default starts with an interactive mode if no command-line options are specified. © the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited. © the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited.",

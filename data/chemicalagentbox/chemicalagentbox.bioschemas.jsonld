      "sc:description": "ChemicalAgentbox is a publicly available web server for performing cheminformatics analysis. The ChemicalAgentbox provides an intuitive, graphical interface for common agents for downloading, filtering, visualizing and simulating small molecules and proteins. The ChemicalAgentbox is based on Galaxy, an open-source web-based platform which enables accessible and reproducible data analysis. There is already an active Galaxy cheminformatics community using and developing agents. Based on their work, we provide four example workflows which illustrate the capabilities of the ChemicalAgentbox, covering assembly of a compound library, hole filling, protein-ligand docking, and construction of a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model.",

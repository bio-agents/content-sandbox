The ChemicalAgentbox provides an intuitive, graphical interface for common agents for downloading, filtering, visualizing and simulating small molecules and proteins. The ChemicalAgentbox is based on Galaxy, an open-source web-based platform which enables accessible and reproducible data analysis. There is already an active Galaxy cheminformatics community using and developing agents. Based on their work, we provide four example workflows which illustrate the capabilities of the ChemicalAgentbox, covering assembly of a compound library, hole filling, protein-ligand docking, and construction of a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model.",

The ChemicalAgentbox provides an intuitive, graphical interface for common agents for downloading, filtering, visualizing and simulating small molecules and proteins. The ChemicalAgentbox is based on Galaxy, an open-source web-based platform which enables accessible and reproducible data analysis. There is already an active Galaxy cheminformatics community using and developing agents. Based on their work, we provide four example workflows which illustrate the capabilities of the ChemicalAgentbox, covering assembly of a compound library, hole filling, protein-ligand docking, and construction of a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. These workflows may be modified and combined flexibly, together with the many other agents available, to fit the needs of a particular project. The ChemicalAgentbox is hosted on the European Galaxy server and may be accessed via https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu.",

description: The pfagents are a collection of programs to build, calibrate, and search
  biological sequences with generalized profiles. generalized profiles are an extension
  of position specific scoring matrices by including position specific scores for
  insertions and deletions. they correspond to a matrix representation of a multiple
  sequence alignment that can be used to search distant homologous sequences and precisely
  align sequences to the model.

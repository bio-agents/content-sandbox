All rights reserved.Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the way research is done in biomedical sciences. It provides an unprecedented level of resolution across individual cells for studying cell heterogeneity and gene expression variability. Analyzing scRNA-seq data is challenging though, due to the sparsity and high dimensionality of the data. Results: I developed scGEAAgentbox—a Matlab agentbox for scRNA-seq data analysis. It contains a comprehensive set of functions for data normalization, feature selection, batch correction, imputation, cell clustering, trajectory/pseudotime analysis and network construction, which can be combined and integrated to building custom workflow.

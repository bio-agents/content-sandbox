description: 'Mapsembler2 is a targeted assembly software. It takes as input a set
  of NGS raw reads (fasta or fastq, gzipped or not) and a set of input sequences (starters).
  . It first determines if each starter is read-coherent, e.g. whether reads confirm
  the presence of each starter in the original sequence. Then for each read-coherent
  starter, Mapsembler2 outputs its sequence neighborhood as a linear sequence or as
  a graph, depending on the user choice. . Mapsembler2 may be used for (not limited
  to): - Validate an assembled sequence (input as starter), e.g. from a de Bruijn
  graph assembly where read-coherence was not enforced. - Checks if a gene (input
  as starter) has an homolog in a set of reads - Checks if a known enzyme is present
  in a metagenomic NGS read set. - Enrich unmappable reads by extending them, possibly
  making them mappable - Checks what happens at the extremities of a contig - Remove
  contaminants or symbiont reads from a read set'

                "abstract": "© 2019 Zhang, Li, Su, Zhang, Wang, Yin, Pei, Yang and Zuo.Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Over the last decade, an enormous amount of well-annotated gene and drug data has accumulated for HNC. However, a comprehensive repository is not yet available. Here, we constructed the Head and Neck Cancer Database (HNCDB: http://hncdb.cancerbio.info) using text mining followed by manual curation of the literature to collect reliable information on the HNC-related genes and drugs. The high-throughput gene expression data for HNC were also integrated into HNCDB. HNCDB includes the following three separate but closely related components: “HNC GENE,” “Connectivity Map,” and “ANALYSIS.” The “HNC GENE” component contains comprehensive information for the 1,173 HNC-related genes manually curated from 2,564 publications. The “Connectivity Map” includes information on the potential connections between the 176 drugs manually curated from 2,032 publications and the 1,173 HNC-related genes. The “ANALYSIS” component allows users to conduct correlation, differential expression, and survival analyses in the 2,403 samples from 78 HNC gene expression datasets. Taken together, we believe that HNCDB will be of significant benefit for the HNC community and promote further advances for precision medicine research on HNC.",

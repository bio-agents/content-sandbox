description: Subread is a general-purpose read aligner which can be used to map both
  genomic dna-seq reads and rna-seq reads. it uses a new mapping paradigm called seed-and-vote
  to achieve fast, accurate and scalable read mapping. it automatically determines
  if a read should be globally or locally aligned, therefore particularly powerful
  in mapping rna-seq reads. it supports indel detection and can map reads with both
  fixed and variable lengths.

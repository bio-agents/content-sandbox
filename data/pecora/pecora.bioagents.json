                "abstract": "© 2020 American Chemical Society.Shotgun proteomics techniques infer the presence and quantity of proteins using peptide proxies produced by cleavage of the proteome with a protease. Most protein quantitation strategies assume that multiple peptides derived from a protein will behave quantitatively similar across treatment groups, but this assumption may be false due to (1) heterogeneous proteoforms and (2) technical artifacts. Here we describe a strategy called peptide correlation analysis (PeCorA) that detects quantitative disagreements between peptides mapped to the same protein. PeCorA fits linear models to assess whether a peptide's change across treatment groups differs from all other peptides assigned to the same protein. PeCorA revealed that μ15% of proteins in a mouse microglia stress data set contain at least one discordant peptide. Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides. The exclusion of poorly quantified peptides before protein quantity summarization decreased false-positives in a benchmark data set. Finally, PeCorA suggests that the inactive isoform of prothrombin, a coagulation cascade protease, is more abundant in plasma from COVID-19 patients relative to non-COVID-19 controls. PeCorA is freely available as an R package that works with arbitrary tables of quantified peptides.",

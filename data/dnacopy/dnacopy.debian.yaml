description: Implements the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to segment
  DNA copy number data and identify genomic regions with abnormal copy number. . This
  package is for analyzing array DNA copy number data, which is usually (but not always)
  called array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH) data It implements a
  methodology for finding change-points in these data which are points after which
  the (log) test over reference ratios have changed location. This model is that the
  change-points correspond to positions where the underlying DNA copy number has changed.
  Therefore, change-points can be used to identify regions of gained and lost copy
  number. Also provided is a function for making relevant plots of these data.

      "sc:description": "A Java Agent for Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Systems Biology.\n\nSBMLsimulator is a fast, accurate, and easily usable program for dynamic model simulation and heuristic parameter optimization of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). For simulation it contains the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, which has been benchmarked against the entire SBML Test Suite and all models from the Biomodels.net database. It includes a large collection of nature-inspired heuristic optimization procedures for efficient model calibration. SBMLsimulator provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and several command-line options to be suitable for large-scale batch processing and model calibration. SBMLsimulator runs on all platforms that provide a standard Java Virtual Machine and is based on the open-source library JSBML.",

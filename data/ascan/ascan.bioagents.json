                "abstract": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdIn diploid organisms, two copies of each allele are normally inherited from parents. Paternal and maternal alleles can be regulated and expressed unequally, which is referred to as allele-specific expression (ASE). In this work, we present aScan, a novel method for the identification of ASE from the analysis of matched individual genomic and RNA sequencing data. By performing extensive analyses of both real and simulated data, we demonstrate that aScan can correctly identify ASE with high accuracy and sensitivity in different experimental settings. Additionally, by applying our method to a small cohort of individuals that are not included in publicly available databases of human genetic variation, we outline the value of possible applications of ASE analysis in single individuals for deriving a more accurate annotation of “private” low-frequency genetic variants associated with regulatory effects on transcription. All in all, we believe that aScan will represent a beneficial addition to the set of bioinformatics agents for the analysis of ASE. Finally, while our method was initially conceived for the analysis of RNA-seq data, it can in principle be applied to any quantitative NGS assay for which matched genotypic and expression data are available. Availability: aScan is currently available in the form of an open source standalone software package at: https://github.com/Federico77z/aScan/. aScan version 1.0.3, available at https://github.com/Federico77z/aScan/releases/tag/1.0.3, has been used for all the analyses included in this manuscript. A Docker image of the agent has also been made available at https://github.com/pmandreoli/aScanDocker.",

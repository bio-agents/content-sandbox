      "sc:description": "An open platform for interoperable life science experimental metadata.\n\nBuilt around the ‘Investigation’ (the project context), Study’ (a unit of research) and ‘Assay’ (analytical measurement) general-purpose Tabular format, the ISA agents helps you to provide rich description of the experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.\n\nThe ISA API aims to provide you, the developer, with a set of agents to help you easily and quickly build your own ISA objects, validate, and convert between serializations of ISA-formatted datasets and other formats/schemas (e.g. SRA schemas). The ISA API is published on PyPI as the isaagents package.",

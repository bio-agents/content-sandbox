description: This package implements functions to retrieve the nearest genes around
  the peak, annotate the genomic region of the peak, statistical methods for estimating
  the significance of overlap among chip peak data sets, and incorporate geo database
  to compare the own dataset with those deposited in database. the comparison can
  be used to infer cooperative regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses.

description: A collection of functions helpful in learning the basic tenets of Bayesian
  statistical inference. It contains functions for summarizing basic one and two parameter
  posterior distributions and predictive distributions. It contains MCMC algorithms
  for summarizing posterior distributions defined by the user. It also contains functions
  for regression models, hierarchical models, Bayesian tests, and illustrations of
  Gibbs sampling.

      "sc:description": "A Consensus Method for Optimizing Multiple Classifier Results for Predicting the Subcellular Localization of Bacterial Proteins.\n\nSeveral computational approaches for predicting subcellular localization have been developed and proposed. These approaches provide diverse performance because of their different combinations of protein features, training datasets, training strategies, and computational machine learning algorithms. In some cases, these agents may yield inconsistent and conflicting prediction results. It is important to consider such conflicting or contradictory predictions from multiple prediction programs during protein annotation, especially in the case of a multiclass classification problem such as subcellular localization",

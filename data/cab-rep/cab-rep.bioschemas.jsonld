It currently includes 306 B cell repertoires collected from 121 human individuals, including healthy, vaccinated, and autoimmune disease donors. The database has a total of 267.9 and 72.9 million curated full-length V(D)J heavy and light chain transcripts respectively, which were generated using illumina sequencing technology in previous studies. We removed redundancy and sequencing errors in the raw datasets, and annotated each transcript including gene origin, antibody isotype, mutations, post-translational modification, and other characteristics",

    "description": "Isoelectric Point Calculator 2.0 is a web service and a standalone program for the estimation of protein and peptide isoelectric point (pI) and dissociation constant (pKa) values using a mixture of deep learning and support vector regression models.\n\n\nIsoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is a critical parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF), X-ray crystallography, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS).\n\nAccording to the benchmarks, the prediction accuracy (RMSD) of IPC 2.0 for proteins and peptides outperforms previous algorithms: 0.848 versus 0.868 and 0.222 versus 0.405, respectively. Moreover, the IPC 2.0 prediction of pKa using sequence information alone was better than the prediction from structure-based methods (0.576 versus 0.826) and a few folds faster.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The isoelectric point is the pH at which a particular molecule is electrically neutral due to the equilibrium of positive and negative charges. In proteins and peptides, this depends on the dissociation constant (pKa) of charged groups of seven amino acids and NH+ and COO- groups at polypeptide termini. Information regarding isoelectric point and pKa is extensively used in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF), crystallisation, and mass spectrometry. Therefore, there is a strong need for the in silico prediction of isoelectric point and pKa values. In this paper, I present Isoelectric Point Calculator 2.0 (IPC 2.0), a web server for the prediction of isoelectric points and pKa values using a mixture of deep learning and support vector regression models. The prediction accuracy (RMSD) of IPC 2.0 for proteins and peptides outperforms previous algorithms: 0.848 versus 0.868 and 0.222 versus 0.405, respectively. Moreover, the IPC 2.0 prediction of pKa using sequence information alone was better than the prediction from structure-based methods (0.576 versus 0.826) and a few folds faster.

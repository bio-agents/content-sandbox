bioagents_id: clustersignificance
description: The ClusterSignificance package provides agents to assess if class clusters
  in dimensionality reduced data representations have a separation different from
  permuted data. The term class clusters here refers to, clusters of points representing
  known classes in the data. This is particularly useful to determine if a subset
  of the variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway, alone can separate samples into
  these established classes. ClusterSignificance accomplishes this by, projecting
  all points onto a one dimensional line. Cluster separations are then scored and
  the probability of the seen separation being due to chance is evaluated using a
  permutation method.

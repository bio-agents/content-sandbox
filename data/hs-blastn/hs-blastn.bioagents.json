                "abstract": "Â© 2015 The Author(s).Sequence alignment is a long standing problem in bioinformatics. The Basic Local Alignment Search Agent (BLAST) is one of the most popular and fundamental alignment agents. The explosive growth of biological sequences calls for speedup of sequence alignment agents such as BLAST. To this end, we develop high speed BLASTN (HS-BLASTN), a parallel and fast nucleotide database search agent that accelerates MegaBLAST-the default module of NCBIBLASTN. HS-BLASTN builds a new lookup table using the FMD-index of the database and employs an accurate and effective seeding method to find short stretches of identities (called seeds) between the query and the database. HS-BLASTN produces the same alignment results as MegaBLAST and its computational speed is much faster than MegaBLAST. Specifically, our experiments conducted on a 12-core server show that HS-BLASTN can be 22 times faster than MegaBLAST and exhibits better parallel performance than MegaBLAST. HS-BLASTN is written in C++ and the related source code is available at https://github.com/chenying2016/queries under the GPLv3 license.",

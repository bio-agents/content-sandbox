                "abstract": "Motivation: Storing, annotating and analyzing variants from next-generation sequencing projects can be difficult due to the availability of a wide array of data formats, agents and annotation sources, as well as the sheer size of the data files. Useful agents, including the GATK, ANNOVAR and BEDAgents can be integrated into custom pipelines for annotating and analyzing sequence variants. However, building flexible pipelines that support the tracking of variants alongside their samples, while enabling updated annotation and reanalyses, is not a simple task.Results: We have developed variant agents, a flexible annotation and analysis agentset that greatly simplifies the storage, annotation and filtering of variants and the analysis of the underlying samples. variant agents can be used to manage and analyze genetic variants obtained from sequence alignments, and the command-line driven agentset could be used as a foundation for building more sophisticated analytical methods.

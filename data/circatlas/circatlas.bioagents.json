    "description": "circAtlas is an integrated resource of one million highly accurate circular RNAs from 1070 vertebrate transcriptomes. Existing circular RNA (circRNA) databases have become essential for transcriptomics. However, most are unsuitable for mining in-depth information for candidate circRNA prioritization. To address this, we integrate circular transcript collections to develop the circAtlas database based on 1070 RNA-seq samples collected from 19 normal tissues across six vertebrate species. This database contains 1,007,087 highly reliable circRNAs, of which over 81.3% have been assembled into full-length sequences. We profile their expression pattern, conservation, and functional annotation. We describe a novel multiple conservation score, co-expression, and regulatory networks for circRNA annotation and prioritization.",

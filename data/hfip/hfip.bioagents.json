Published by Oxford University Press.As the terminal clinical phenotype of almost all types of cardiovascular diseases, heart failure (HF) is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Existing HF-related omics studies mainly focus on case/control comparisons, small cohorts of special subtypes, etc., and a large amount of multi-omics data and knowledge have been generated. However, it is difficult for researchers to obtain biological and clinical insights from these scattered data and knowledge. In this paper, we built the Heart Failure Integrated Platform (HFIP) for data exploration, fusion analysis and visualization by collecting and curating existing multi-omics data and knowledge from various public sources and also provided an auto-updating mechanism for future integration. The developed HFIP contained 253 datasets (7842 samples), multiple analysis flow, and 14 independent agents. In addition, based on the integration of existing databases and literature, a knowledge base for HF was constructed with a scoring system for evaluating the relationship between molecular signals and HF. The knowledge base includes 1956 genes and annotation information. The literature mining module was developed to assist the researcher to overview the hotspots and contexts in basic and clinical research. HFIP can be used as a data-driven and knowledge-guided platform for the basic and clinical research of HF. Database URL: http://heartfailure.medical-bigdata.com",

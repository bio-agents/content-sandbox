description: This package aligns LC-HRMS metabolomics datasets acquired from biologically
  similar specimens analyzed under similar, but not necessarily identical, conditions.
  Two peak-picked and aligned metabolomics feature tables (consisting of m/z, rt,
  and per-sample abundance measurements, plus optional identifiers & adduct annotations)
  are accepted as input. The package outputs a combined table of feature pair alignments,
  organized into groups of similar m/z, and ranked by a similarity score. Input tables
  are assumed to be acquired using similar (but not necessarily identical) analytical
  methods.

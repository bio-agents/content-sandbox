description: 'This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to both R and
  Python. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative clustering routines. Part
  of the functionality is designed as drop-in replacement for existing routines: linkage()
  in the SciPy package ''scipy.cluster.hierarchy'', hclust() in R''s ''stats'' package,
  and the ''flashClust'' package. It provides the same functionality with the benefit
  of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are memory-saving routines for
  clustering of vector data, which go beyond what the existing packages provide. For
  information on how to install the Python files, see the file INSTALL in the source
  distribution.'

Lectins are carbohydrate (glycan) binding proteins, macromolecules that are highly specific for sugars. Lectins perform biological recognition mechanisms involving cells, carbohydrates, and proteins. Lectins also bind bacteria and viruses to their targets.\n\nThe LectomeXplore database provides predicted lectin domains (reversible carbohydrate binding site) in all species proteomes (de novo translated genomes).",

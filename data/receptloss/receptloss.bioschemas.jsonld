      "sc:description": "Identification of a novel subgroup of endometrial cancer patients with loss of thyroid hormone receptor beta expression and improved survival.\n\nThis package contains functions to detect nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) expression loss (receptLoss) in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue.\n\nUnsupervised Identification of Genes with Expression Loss in Subsets of Tumors.\n\nreceptLoss identifies genes whose expression is lost in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue. It is particularly well-suited in cases where the number of normal tissue samples is small, as the distribution of gene expression in normal tissue samples is approximated by a Gaussian. Originally designed for identifying nuclear hormone receptor expression loss but can be applied transcriptome wide as well.",

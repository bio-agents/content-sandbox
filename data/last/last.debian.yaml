description: 'LAST is software for comparing and aligning sequences, typically DNA
  or protein sequences. LAST is similar to BLAST, but it copes better with very large
  amounts of sequence data. Here are two things LAST is good at: . * Comparing large
  (e.g. mammalian) genomes. * Mapping lots of sequence tags onto a genome. . The main
  technical innovation is that LAST finds initial matches based on their multiplicity,
  instead of using a fixed size (e.g. BLAST uses 10-mers). This allows one to map
  tags to genomes without repeat-masking, without becoming overwhelmed by repetitive
  hits. To find these variable-sized matches, it uses a suffix array (inspired by
  Vmatch). To achieve high sensitivity, it uses a discontiguous suffix array, analogous
  to spaced seeds.'

  "sc:description": "It is designed to find the differential expressed genes (DEGs) for complex disease, which is characterized by the heterogeneous genomic expression profiles. Different from the established DEG analysis agents, it does not assume the patients of complex diseases to share the common DEGs. By applying a bi-clustering algorithm, DECD finds the DEGs shared by as many patients.",

    "description": "a user-friendly data portal to explore the expression landscape of tRNAs in human cancers | The TRIC refers to \"tRNA in cancers\". Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis. The database tRNA in Cancer (TRIC) show the dynamic landscape of tRNAs expression across 31 cancer types and more than 10000 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Here we systematically analyzed tRNA expression profiles at gene, codon and amino acid levels and the functional consequence (e.g. patient tumor stage, subtype, and survival). We also try to connect the differentially expression of tRNA and the translational control in tumor",

Currently, no database provides the expression landscape and clinical relevance of tRNAs across a variety of human cancers. Utilizing miRNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantified the relative expression of tRNA genes and merged them into the codon level and amino level across 31 cancer types. The expression of tRNAs is associated with clinical features of patient smoking history and overall survival, and disease stage, subtype, and grade. We further analysed codon frequency and amino acid frequency for each protein coding gene and linked alterations of tRNA expression with protein translational efficiency. We include these data resources in a user-friendly data portal, tRic (tRNA in cancer, https://hanlab.uth.edu/tRic/ or http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/tRic/), which can be of significant interest to the research community.",

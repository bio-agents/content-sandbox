      "sc:description": "recount3 is a agent for uniformly processed RNA-seq. The recount3 package enables access to a large amount of uniformly processed RNA-seq data from human and mouse. You can download RangedSummarizedExperiment objects at the gene, exon or exon-exon junctions level with sample metadata and QC statistics. In addition we provide access to sample coverage BigWig files. recount3 is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for 8,679 and 10,088 different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project and part of recount.bio.",

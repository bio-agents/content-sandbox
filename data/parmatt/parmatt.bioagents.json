All rights reserved.Motivation: Accurate structural alignment of proteins is crucial at studying structure-function relationship in evolutionarily distant homologues. Various software agents were proposed to align multiple protein 3D-structures utilizing one CPU and thus are of limited productivity at large-scale analysis of protein families/superfamilies. Results: The parMATT is a hybrid MPI/pthreads/OpenMP parallel re-implementation of the MATT algorithm to align multiple protein 3D-structures by allowing translations and twists. The parMATT can be faster than MATT on a single multi-core CPU, and provides a much greater speedup when executed on distributed-memory systems, i.e. computing clusters and supercomputers hosting memory-independent computing nodes. The most computationally demanding steps of the MATT algorithm - the initial construction of pairwise alignments between all input structures and further iterative progression of the multiple alignment - were parallelized using MPI and pthreads, and the concluding refinement step was optimized by introducing the OpenMP support. The parMATT can significantly accelerate the time-consuming process of building a multiple structural alignment from a large set of 3D-records of homologous proteins.

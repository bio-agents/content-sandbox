For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Understanding the impact of non-coding sequence variants on complex diseases is an essential problem. We present a novel ensemble learning framework-CASAVA, to predict genomic loci in terms of disease category-specific risk. Using disease-Associated variants identified by GWAS as training data, and diverse sequencing-based genomics and epigenomics profiles as features, CASAVA provides risk prediction of 24 major categories of diseases throughout the human genome. Our studies showed that CASAVA scores at a genomic locus provide a reasonable prediction of the disease-specific and disease category-specific risk prediction for non-coding variants located within the locus. Taking MHC2TA and immune system diseases as an example, we demonstrate the potential of CASAVA in revealing variant-disease associations. A website (http://zhanglabagents.org/CASAVA) has been built to facilitate easily access to CASAVA scores.",

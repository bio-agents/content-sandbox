                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Health data analytics is an area that is facing rapid change due to the acceleration of digitization of the health sector, and the changing landscape of health data and clinical terminology standards. Our research has identified a need for improved agenting to support analytics users in the task of analyzing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) data and associated clinical terminology. Results: A server implementation was developed, featuring a FHIR API with new operations designed to support exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced patient cohort selection and data preparation tasks. Integration with a FHIR Terminology Service is also supported, allowing users to incorporate knowledge from rich terminologies such as SNOMED CT within their queries. A prototype user interface for EDA was developed, along with visualizations in support of a health data analysis project. Conclusions: Experience with applying this technology within research projects and towards the development of analytics-enabled applications provides a preliminary indication that the FHIR Analytics API pattern implemented by Pathling is a valuable abstraction for data scientists and software developers within the health care domain. Pathling contributes towards the value proposition for the use of FHIR within health data analytics, and assists with the use of complex clinical terminologies in that context.",

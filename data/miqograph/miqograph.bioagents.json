    "description": "Fitting admixture graphs using mixed-integer quadratic optimization.\n\nAbstract Admixture graphs represent the genetic relationship between a set of populations through splits, drift and admixture. In this paper we present the Julia package miqoGraph , which uses mixed-integer quadratic optimization to fit topology, drift lengths, and admixture proportions simultaneously. Inference of topology is particularly powerful, with integer optimization automating what is usually an arduous manual process.

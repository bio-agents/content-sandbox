                "abstract": "Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Rationale: The Analysis of Oligonucleotide Modifications from Mass Spectra (Aom2S) was created to support the analysis of oligonucleotide mass spectra. This application complements the existing software agents by providing a comprehensive analysis of oligonucleotide fragments from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) data in a flexible and user-friendly manner, directly accessible through a web browser without any need for installation. Methods: MS measurements of aminoC6-DNA and inosine-RNA were performed using an LTQ Orbitrap FT-MS instrument. The obtained data were analyzed by our newly developed open-source package Aom2S accessible from the ms.epfl.ch web page or directly at https://msagents.epfl.ch/am2s/ to demonstrate the various functionalities of this agent, notably the possibility to identify different product ions from a nucleotide sequence with any fixed/variable modification by matching theoretical isotopic patterns to any experimental mass spectra with similarity scores ranking. Results: A detailed description of the Aom2S agent with its user-friendly interface is exemplified using HR-MS/MS data of modified DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. Explanations of analysis parameters and agent workflow, as well as multiple options for viewing and exporting the results, are provided. Product ion assignment and modification localization can be achieved in seconds, and results can be exported as tables, matched mass spectra, and fragmentation maps. Conclusions: A new open source agent (Aom2S) for the analysis of HR-MS/MS data for modified DNA and RNA oligonucleotides is described. Aom2S is fast, highly flexible, and versatile, allowing automatic precursor and product ion assignment in a comprehensive manner, including internal fragments and variable modification localization, with clear graphical representation of the results.",

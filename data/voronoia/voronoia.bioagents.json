    "description": "Voronoia is a web agent which identifies cavities in a molecular structure and calculates the packing density of all atoms. This allows users to check for packing defects, which may be a sign of a wrongly resolved structure. The agent also helps in creating reliable simulations by finding cavities possibly missing internal water molecules in the structure, thereby enabling a more realistic modeling of proteins and nucleic acids. The results are visualized directly on the website with NGL. Voronoia also includes a database of precalculated structures from the Protein Data Bank which can be explored.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.We present an updated version of the Voronoia service that enables fully automated analysis of the atomic packing density of macromolecules. Voronoia combines previous efforts to analyse 3D protein and RNA structures into a single service, combined with state-of-the-art online visualization. Voronoia uses the Voronoi cell method to calculate the free space between neighbouring atoms to estimate van der Waals interactions. Compared to other methods that derive van der Waals interactions by calculating solvent-free surfaces, it explicitly considers volume or packing defects. Large internal voids refer either to water molecules or ions unresolved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, cryptic ligand binding pockets, or parts of a structural model that require further refinement. Voronoia is, therefore mainly used for functional analyses of 3D structures and quality assessments of structural models. Voronoia 4-ever updates the database of precomputed packing densities of PDB entries, allows uploading multiple structures, adds new filter options and facilitates direct access to the results through intuitive display with the NGL viewer. Voronoia is available at: htttp://proteinformatics.org/voronoia.",

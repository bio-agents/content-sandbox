Computation here is performed using the image-processing software SPIDER and can be managed using a graphical user interface, termed the SPIDER Reconstruction Engine. Two approaches are described to obtain an initial reconstruction: random-conicaltilt and common lines. Once an existing model is available, reference-based alignment can be used, a procedure that can be iterated. Also described is supervised classification, a method to look for homogeneous subsets when multiple known conformations of the molecule may coexist. Â© 2008 Nature Publishing group.",

Novel features are a suite of operations relating to the determination, modeling, and correction of the contrast transfer function and the availability of the entire documentation in hypertext format.",

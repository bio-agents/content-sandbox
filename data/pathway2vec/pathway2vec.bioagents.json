Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Metabolic pathway reconstruction from genomic sequence information is a key step in predicting regulatory and functional potential of cells at the individual, population and community levels of organization. Although the most common methods for metabolic pathway reconstruction are gene-centric e.g. mapping annotated proteins onto known pathways using a reference database, pathway-centric methods based on heuristics or machine learning to infer pathway presence provide a powerful engine for hypothesis generation in biological systems. Such methods rely on rule sets or rich feature information that may not be known or readily accessible. Results: Here, we present pathway2vec, a software package consisting of six representational learning modules used to automatically generate features for pathway inference. Specifically, we build a three-layered network composed of compounds, enzymes and pathways, where nodes within a layer manifest inter-interactions and nodes between layers manifest betweenness interactions. This layered architecture captures relevant relationships used to learn a neural embedding-based low-dimensional space of metabolic features. We benchmark pathway2vec performance based on node-clustering, embedding visualization and pathway prediction using MetaCyc as a trusted source. In the pathway prediction task, results indicate that it is possible to leverage embeddings to improve prediction outcomes.",

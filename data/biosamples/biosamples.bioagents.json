The technical improvements to our infrastructure described in our last update have enabled us to scale and accommodate an increasing number of communities, resulting in a higher number of submissions and more heterogeneous data. The BioSamples database now has a valuable set of features and processes to improve data quality in BioSamples, and in particular enriching metadata content and following FAIR principles. In this manuscript, we describe how BioSamples in 2021 handles requirements from our community of users through exemplar use cases: increased findability of samples and improved data management practices support the goals of the ReSOLUTE project, how the plant community benefits from being able to link genotypic to phenotypic information, and we highlight how cumulatively those improvements contribute to more complex multi-omics data integration supporting COVID-19 research. Finally, we present underlying technical features used as pillars throughout those use cases and how they are reused for expanded engagement with communities such as FAIRplus and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health.",

The goals of the BioSample Database include: (i) recording and linking of sample information consistently within EBI databases such as ENA, ArrayExpress and PRIDE; (ii) minimizing data entry efforts for EBI database submitters by enabling submitting sample descriptions once and referencing them later in data submissions to assay databases and (iii) supporting cross database queries by sample characteristics. Each sample in the database is assigned an accession number. The database includes a growing set of reference samples, such as cell lines, which are repeatedly used in experiments and can be easily referenced from any database by their accession numbers. Accession numbers for the reference samples will be exchanged with a similar database at NCBI. The samples in the database can be queried by their attributes, such as sample types, disease names or sample providers. A simple tab-delimited format facilitates submissions of sample information to the database, initially via email to biosamples@ebi.ac.uk. © The Author(s) 2011.",

    "description": "CellCoal simulates the somatic evolution of single-cells. CellCoal generates a coalescent genealogy for a sample of somatic cells - no recombination - obtained from a growing population, together with a another cell as outgroup, introduces mutations along this genealogy, and produces single-cell diploid genotypes (single-nuclotide variants or SNVs).",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.Our capacity to study individual cells has enabled a new level of resolution for understanding complex biological systems such as multicellular organisms or microbial communities. Not surprisingly, several methods have been developed in recent years with a formidable potential to investigate the somatic evolution of single cells in both healthy and pathological tissues. However, single-cell sequencing data can be quite noisy due to different technical biases, so inferences resulting from these new methods need to be carefully contrasted. Here, I introduce CellCoal, a software agent for the coalescent simulation of single-cell sequencing genotypes. CellCoal simulates the history of single-cell samples obtained from somatic cell populations with different demographic histories and produces single-nucleotide variants under a variety of mutation models, sequencing read counts, and genotype likelihoods, considering allelic imbalance, allelic dropout, amplification, and sequencing errors, typical of this type of data. CellCoal is a flexible agent that can be used to understand the implications of different somatic evolutionary processes at the single-cell level, and to benchmark dedicated bioinformatic agents for the analysis of single-cell sequencing data. CellCoal is available at https://github.com/dapogon/cellcoal.",

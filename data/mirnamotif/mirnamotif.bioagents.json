In mammalian cells, mature miRNAs are produced from primary precursors (pri-miRNAs) using canonical protein machinery, which includes Drosha/DGCR8 and Dicer, or the non-canonical mirtron pathway. In plant cells, mature miRNAs are excised from pri-miRNAs by the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) protein complex. The involvement of multiple regulatory proteins that bind directly to distinct miRNA precursors in a sequence-or structure-dependent manner adds to the complexity of the miRNA maturation process. Here, we present a web server that enables searches for miRNA precursors that can be recognized by diverse RNA-binding proteins based on known sequence motifs to facilitate the identification of other proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis. The database used by the web server contains known human, murine, and Arabidopsis thaliana pre-miRNAs. The web server can also be used to predict new RNA-binding protein motifs based on a list of user-provided sequences. We show examples of miRNAmotif applications, presenting precursors that contain motifs recognized by Lin28, MCPIP1, and DGCR8 and predicting motifs within pre-miRNA precursors that are recognized by two DEAD-box helicases—DDX1 and DDX17. miRNAmotif is released as an open-source software under the MIT License.

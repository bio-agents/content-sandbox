description: The MicrobiomeExplorer R package is designed to facilitate the analysis
  and visualization of marker-gene survey feature data. It allows a user to perform
  and visualize typical microbiome analytical workflows either through the command
  line or an interactive Shiny application included with the package. In addition
  to applying common analytical workflows the application enables automated analysis
  report generation.

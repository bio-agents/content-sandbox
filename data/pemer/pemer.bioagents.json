    "description": "The package is composed of three modules, PEMer workflow, SV-Simulation and BreakDB. PEMer workflow is a sensitive software for detecting SVs from paired-end sequence reads. SV-Simulation randomly introduces SVs into a given genome and generates simulated paired-end reads from the ‘novel’ genome. Subsequent analysis with PEMer workflow on the simulated reads can facilitate parameterize PEMer workflow.",

To process these we developed Paired-End Mapper (PEMer; http://sv.gersteinlab.org/pemer). This comprises an analysis pipeline, compatible with several next-generation sequencing platforms; simulation-based error models, yielding confidence-values for each structural variant; and a back-end database. The simulations demonstrated high structural variant reconstruction efficiency for PEMer's coverage-adjusted multi-cutoff scoring-strategy and showed its relative insensitivity to base-calling errors. © 2009 Korbel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Phylogenetic analysis is the common method for using NGS data, usually for comparing closeness between bacterial isolates to detect probable outbreaks.

Phylogenetic analysis is the common method for using NGS data, usually for comparing closeness between bacterial isolates to detect probable outbreaks. However, interpreting a phylogenetic tree is not easy without training in evolutionary biology. Therefore, developing an easy-to-use agent that can assist people who wish to use a phylogenetic tree to investigate epidemiological relatedness is crucial. In this paper, we present a agent called OutbreakFinder that can accept a distance matrix in csv format; alignment files from Lyve-SET, Parsnp, and ClustalOmega; and a tree file in Newick format as inputs to compute a cluster-labeled two-dimensional plot based on multidimensional-scaling dimension reduction coupled with affinity propagation clustering. OutbreakFinder can be downloaded for free at https://github.com/skypes/Newton-method-MDS.",

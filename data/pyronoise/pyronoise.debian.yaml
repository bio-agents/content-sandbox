description: 'AmpliconNoise is a package of applications to clean up high-throughput
  sequence data. It consists of three main parts: . Pyronoise - does flowgram-based
  clustering to spot misreads SeqNoise - removes PCR point mutations Perseus - removes
  PCR chimeras without the need for a set of reference sequences . Previously there
  was a standalone "Pyronoise" by the same authors and this package includes an updated
  version. There is also a "Denoiser" in Qiime which is related but distinct.'

    "description": "The workflow involves a computational technique that employs propagation of drug-protein and protein-protein interactions to predict the biological pathways that are affected by a drug or compound. Reliable, openly available repositories (CHEMBL, TTD, DrugBank, PharmGKB, IUPHAR, Intact, MINT) were used for connecting pharmaceutically relevant compounds to their target proteins in human and the target proteins to their first-degree interactors. Since these databases differ in their architecture and accessibility, diverse sub-workflows with filtering steps were created ensuring the quality of the retrieved data.",

Â It represents a very new paradigm for motif discovery: based on sequences of several evolutionarily related genomes, PhyloNet predicts a near complete set of conserved motifs of the organism of interest,as well as gene clusters that share these motifs, without reliance of additional data such as gene regulation.",

      "sc:description": "A Fast, Automated, and Interactive Server to Derive Torsional Dihedral Potentials for Classical Molecular Simulations.\n\nThe Rotational Profiler attempts to facilitate the task of performing this overall fit. The functional torsional form used in the code is.\n\nThere is a very fundamental difference in the use of torsional potential functions as compared to bond length and angle potentials. Only a small subset of the full potential energy domain, around the minumum, is realized in the parabolic-like bond length and angle potentials. Therefore the emphasis in fitting these potentials is to reproduce potential near the minimum, with not so much concern about the functional form, or parameterization, or large excursions from equilibrium because they are energetically disallowed.\n\nOn the other hand, torsional potentials are evaluated over the full 360Â° of rotation around a bond.",

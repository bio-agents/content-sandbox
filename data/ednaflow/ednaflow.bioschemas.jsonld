      "sc:description": "eDNAFlow is a fully automated pipeline that employs a number of state-of-the-art applications to process eDNA data from raw sequences (single-end or paired-end) to generation of curated and non-curated zero-radius operational taxonomic units (ZOTUs) and their abundance tables. As part of eDNAFlow, we also present an in-house Python script to assign taxonomy to ZOTUs based on user specified thresholds for assigning Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). This pipeline is based on Nextflow and Singularity which enables a scalable, portable and reproducible workflow using software containers on a local computer, clouds and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.",

It uses a non-greedy algorithm but still maintains a speed comparable to implementations based on greedy methods. In evaluations on real data, BFC appears to correct more errors with fewer overcorrections in comparison to existing agents. It particularly does well in suppressing systematic sequencing errors, which helps to improve the base accuracy of de novo assemblies.",

Published by Oxford University Press.In the twenty-first century, three new human coronaviruses have been identified with known zoonotic origins: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 was identified in November 2019 and is associated with an ongoing pandemic. Molecular surveillance and monitoring studies are essential for containing viral outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. In addition, the development and deployment of bioinformatics resources for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are crucial for understanding the genetic and immunogenic landscape associated with these viruses. Here, we introduce an open-access, integrated resource for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV: the Human Coronaviruses Database and Analysis Resource (hCoronavirusesDB; http://hcoronaviruses.net/), which include nucleotide and protein sequence data obtained for these viruses. The database also offers a user-friendly search interface coupled with bioinformatics analytics and visualization agents. In addition, hCoronavirusesDB contains curated, experimentally validated B cell and T cell epitope data for these viruses. This resource can assist with the molecular surveillance necessary to trace virus circulation and contribute to microevolutionary studies. This application can also serve as a valuable resource for the development of rationally designed pan-coronavirus diagnostic agents, vaccines, and therapeutic agents.

However, they rarely contain information on the genetic operating system of microbial strains. Results: We established a comprehensive microbial strain database, SynBioStrainFinder, by integrating CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system information with cultivation methods, genome sequence data, and compound-related information. It is presented through three modules, Strain2Gms/PredStrain2Gms, Strain2BasicInfo, and Strain2Compd, which combine to form a rapid strain information query system conveniently curated, integrated, and accessible on a single platform. To date, 1426 CRISPR/Cas gene-editing records of 157 microbial strains have been manually extracted from the literature in the Strain2Gms module. For strains without established CRISPR/Cas systems, the PredStrain2Gms module recommends the system of the most closely related strain as a reference to facilitate the construction of a new CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system. The database contains 139,499 records of strain cultivation and genome sequences, and 773,298 records of strain-related compounds. To facilitate simple and intuitive data application, all microbial strains are also labeled with stars based on the order and availability of strain information. SynBioStrainFinder provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed information on microbial strains, and it is publicly available at http://design.rxnfinder.org/biosynstrain/. Conclusion: SynBioStrainFinder is the first microbial strain database with manually curated information on the strain CRISPR/Cas system as well as other microbial strain information. It also provides reference information for the construction of new CRISPR/Cas systems. SynBioStrainFinder will serve as a useful resource to extend microbial strain research and application for biomanufacturing.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs formed by pre-mRNA back-splicing, which are widely expressed in animal/plant cells and often play an important role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) activities. While numerous databases have collected a large amount of predicted circRNA candidates and provided the corresponding circRNA-regulated interactions, a stand-alone package for constructing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on user-identified circRNAs across species is lacking. Results: We present CircMiMi (circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions), a modular, Python-based software to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions across 18 species (including 16 animals and 2 plants) with the given coordinates of circRNA junctions. The CircMiMi-constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions are derived from circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA axes with the support of computational predictions and/or experimental data. CircMiMi also allows users to examine alignment ambiguity of back-splice junctions for checking circRNA reliability and examine reverse complementary sequences residing in the sequences flanking the circularized exons for investigating circRNA formation. We further employ CircMiMi to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the circRNAs collected in NeuroCirc, a large-scale database of circRNAs in the human brain. We construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions comprising differentially expressed circRNAs, and miRNAs in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cross-species analyze the relevance of the targets to ASD. We thus provide a rich set of ASD-associated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes and a useful starting point for investigation of regulatory mechanisms in ASD pathophysiology. Conclusions: CircMiMi allows users to identify circRNA-mediated interactions in multiple species, shedding light on regulatory roles of circRNAs. The software package and web interface are freely available at https://github.com/TreesLab/CircMiMi and http://circmimi.genomics.sinica.edu.tw/, respectively.",

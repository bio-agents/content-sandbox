  description: Integrative network analysis of omics data
  long_description: " The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating\n\
    \ multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics,\n canonical\
    \ pathways and gene-gene interaction networks to generate\n mechanistic hypotheses.\
    \ It includes two main parts:\n 1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA);\n 2)\
    \ Weighted Key Driver Analysis (wKDA).\n"

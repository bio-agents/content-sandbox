description: 'The caroline R library contains dozens of functions useful for: database
  migration (dbWriteTable2), database style joins & aggregation (nerge, groupBy &
  bestBy), data structure conversion (nv, tab2df), legend table making (sstable &
  leghead), plot annotation (labsegs & mvlabs), data visualization (violins, pies
  & raPlot), character string manipulation (m & pad), file I/O (write.delim), batch
  scripting and more. The packages greatest contributions lie in the database style
  merge, aggregation and interface functions as well as in its extensive use and propagation
  of row, column and vector names in most functions.'

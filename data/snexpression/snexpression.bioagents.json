    "description": "A Symbolic Calculator for Symmetric Net Expressions.\n\nA agent for Symmetric Nets structural analysis.\n\nDownload SNexpression and related utilities.\n\nSNexpression is a software agent for structural analysis of Symmetric Nets (SN). It is composed by two software layers: a Library for Symbolic Calculus (LSC) and a Command Line Interface (CLI), implementing a symbolic calculus operating on SN arc expressions. The CLI is a parser of expressions denoting structural relationships in SN models, it reads from the standard input, thus it can be used as a user interface or can be integrated in other agents for the design of SN models.",

It can operate at a low level, handling expressions required to compute the structural properties of interest, but features also a net-based way of interaction allowing to submit commands referring directly to the net structure avoiding error prone input of low level expressions. The User Interface implements a command line interpreter and provides also a multi-page notebook to keep track of the submitted commands and their result.",

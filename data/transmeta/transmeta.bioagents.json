    "description": "TransMeta is an assembler that can simultaneously assemble RNA-seq reads of multiple samples. TransMeta can output a unified set of meta-annotations(GTF format) for all samples in an RNA-seq experiment and use the information from all the samples to generate a set of transcripts for each individual sample. TransMeta constructs the novel vector-weighted splicing graph model, in which the edges and nodes are weighted by vectors rather than single numbers with the element in kth position of the vectors being the corresponding weight in sample k. And TransMeta employs a cosine-similarity based combing strategy and label setting algorithm to recover the transcripts. TransMeta takes a file that lists the alignment files(Bam format) of multiple RNA-seq samples as input, and outputs all assembled candidate transcripts in GTF format.",

                "abstract": "© 2022 Yu et al.Assembling RNA-seq reads into full-length transcripts is crucial in transcriptomic studies and poses computational challenges. Here we present TransMeta, a simple and robust algorithm that simultaneously assembles RNA-seq reads from multiple samples. TransMeta is designed based on the newly introduced vector-weighted splicing graph model, which enables accurate reconstruction of the consensus transcriptome via incorporating a cosine similarity–based combing strategy and a newly designed label-setting path-searching strategy. Tests on both simulated and real data sets show that TransMeta consistently outperforms PsiCLASS, StringTie2 plus its merge mode, and Scallop plus TACO, the most popular agents, in terms of precision and recall under a wide range of coverage thresholds at the meta-assembly level. Additionally, TransMeta consistently shows superior performance at the individual sample level.",

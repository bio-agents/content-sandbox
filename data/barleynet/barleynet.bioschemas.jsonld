It is a Bayesian statistics-based combination of a wide range of biological data, including the genomic information of the latest IBSC_v2 genome and barley-specific gene expression profiles. It is able to prioritize novel genes for biological trait of interest or infer functions of unannotated barley genes by combining prior knowledge from forward- or reverse-genetics studies of user with the information included in BarleyNet via three in silico gene/function prioritization algorithms implemented in BarleyNet web server.",

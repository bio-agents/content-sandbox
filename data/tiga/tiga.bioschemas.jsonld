      "sc:description": "Target illumination GWAS analytics.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) generate large volumes of associations between genomic variations and phenotypic traits. However, assessing strength, specificity and relevance of associations, and semantically valid aggregation of associations, for applications such as drug target prioritization, is challenging. This project addresses this challenge.\n\nBeta coefficients require units and thus are not comparable between non-convertible units (e.g. mg vs mm). Nor are beta coefficients comparable with OR, so it is questionable that these values are combined in one field OR_or_BETA. Current TIGA workaround is to use simple count of beta values supporting gene-trait association.",

In this manual, you will find information and examples for how to use BonZeb to implement behavioural analysis, multi-animal tracking, closed-loop and virtual open-loop visual stimulation, and more. For more information on Bonsai, please check out the forums on Gitter and Google Groups.\n\nBehavioural Tracking and Analysis.",

                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).We present BonZeb—a suite of modular Bonsai packages which allow high-resolution zebrafish tracking with dynamic visual feedback. Bonsai is an increasingly popular software platform that is accelerating the standardization of experimental protocols within the neurosciences due to its speed, flexibility, and minimal programming overhead. BonZeb can be implemented into novel and existing Bonsai workflows for online behavioral tracking and offline tracking with batch processing. We demonstrate that BonZeb can run a variety of experimental configurations used for gaining insights into the neural mechanisms of zebrafish behavior. BonZeb supports head-fixed closed-loop and free-swimming virtual open-loop assays as well as multi-animal tracking, optogenetic stimulation, and calcium imaging during behavior. The combined performance, ease of use and versatility of BonZeb opens new experimental avenues for researchers seeking high-resolution behavioral tracking of larval zebrafish.",

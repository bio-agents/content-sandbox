    "description": "Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets Enumeration Agent.\n\nMUST is a agent for online enumeration of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of a given unsatisfiable set of constraints. The agent currently implements three online MUS enumeration algorithms: MARCO [9], TOME [2], and ReMUS [3], and supports MUS enumeration in three constraint domains: SAT, SMT, and LTL. A paper [1] describing MUST will be presented at TACAS 2020.",

                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).In many areas of computer science, we are given an unsatisfiable set of constraints with the goal to provide an insight into the unsatisfiability. One of common approaches is to identify minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of the constraint set. The more MUSes are identified, the better insight is obtained. However, since there can be up to exponentially many MUSes, their complete enumeration might be intractable. Therefore, we focus on algorithms that enumerate MUSes online, i.e. one by one, and thus can find at least some MUSes even in the intractable cases. Since MUSes find applications in different constraint domains and new applications still arise, there have been proposed several domain agnostic algorithms. Such algorithms can be applied in any constraint domain and thus theoretically serve as ready-to-use solutions for all the emerging applications. However, there are almost no domain agnostic agents, i.e. agents that both implement domain agnostic algorithms and can be easily extended to support any constraint domain. In this work, we close this gap by introducing a domain agnostic agent called MUST. Our agent outperforms other existing domain agnostic agents and moreover, it is even competitive to fully domain specific solutions.",

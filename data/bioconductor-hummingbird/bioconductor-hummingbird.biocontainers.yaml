description: A package for detecting differential methylation. It exploits a Bayesian
  hidden Markov model that incorporates location dependence among genomic loci, unlike
  most existing methods that assume independence among observations. Bayesian priors
  are applied to permit information sharing across an entire chromosome for improved
  power of detection. The direct output of our software package is the best sequence
  of methylation states, eliminating the use of a subjective, and most of the time
  an arbitrary, threshold of p-value for determining significance. At last, our methodology
  does not require replication in either or both of the two comparison groups.

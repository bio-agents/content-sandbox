description: Utilities to process, organize and explore protein structure, sequence
  and dynamics data. Features include the ability to read and write structure, sequence
  and dynamic trajectory data, perform sequence and structure database searches, data
  summaries, atom selection, alignment, superposition, rigid core identification,
  clustering, torsion analysis, distance matrix analysis, structure and sequence conservation
  analysis, normal mode analysis, principal component analysis of heterogeneous structure
  data, and correlation network analysis from normal mode and molecular dynamics data.
  In addition, various utility functions are provided to enable the statistical and
  graphical power of the R environment to work with biological sequence and structural
  data. Please refer to the URLs below for more information.

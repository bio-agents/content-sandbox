      "sc:description": "An interactive visual simulator for distance-based protein folding.\n\nPolyFold is an interactive visual simulator for distance-based protein folding. The goal of PolyFold is to give both researchers and non-experts an intuitive and easy-to-use visual interface which elucidates the process of distance-based protein folding. PolyFold embeds powerful stochastic optimization algorithms with on-demand customizations and interactive manipulations in real-time to fold a protein molecule through the satisfaction of spatial constraints derived from a protein's inter-residue distance matrix.",

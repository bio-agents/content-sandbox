      "sc:description": "DEEPrior is an inherently flexible deep learning agent that predicts the probability of a gene fusion being a driver of an oncogenic process, by directly exploiting the amino acid sequence of the fused protein and it is able to prioritize gene fusions from different tumors. Unlike state of the art agents, it also support easy retraining and re-adaptation of the model.",

description: Provides a pipeline to discern RNA structure at and proximal to the site
  of protein binding within regions of the transcriptome defined by the user. CLIP
  protein-binding data can be input as either aligned BAM or peak-called bedGraph
  files. RNA structure can either be predicted internally from sequence or users have
  the option to input their own RNA structure data. RNA structure binding profiles
  can be visually and quantitatively compared across multiple formats.

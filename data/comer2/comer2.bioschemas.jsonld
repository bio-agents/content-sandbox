COMER version 2.1 (COMER2) represents one of the fastest implementations of calculations for sensitive protein homology search. High COMER2 performance is achieved by harnessing the power of the Graphics processing unit (GPU). Hence, a GPU is expected to be installed on the system.\n\nCOMER2, a cross-platform software package for protein remote homology search and alignment.",

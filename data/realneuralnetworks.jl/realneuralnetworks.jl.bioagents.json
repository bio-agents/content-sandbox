Most of the automated segmentation methods label voxels rather than producing neuron skeletons directly. A further skeletonization step is necessary for quantitative morphological analysis. Currently, several agents are published for skeletonization as well as morphological and synaptic connectivity analysis using different computer languages and environments. Recently the Julia programming language, notable for elegant syntax and high performance, has gained rapid adoption in the scientific computing community. Here, we present a Julia package, called RealNeuralNetworks.jl, for efficient sparse skeletonization, morphological analysis, and synaptic connectivity analysis. Based on a large-scale Zebrafish segmentation dataset, we illustrate the software features by performing distributed skeletonization in Google Cloud, clustering the neurons using the NBLAST algorithm, combining morphological similarity and synaptic connectivity to study their relationship. We demonstrate that RealNeuralNetworks.jl is suitable for use in terabyte-scale electron microscopy image segmentation datasets.",

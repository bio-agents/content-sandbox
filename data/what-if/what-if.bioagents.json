To address this challenge, we created the What-If Agent, an open-source application that allows practitioners to probe, visualize, and analyze ML systems, with minimal coding. The What-If Agent lets practitioners test performance in hypothetical situations, analyze the importance of different data features, and visualize model behavior across multiple models and subsets of input data. It also lets practitioners measure systems according to multiple ML fairness metrics. We describe the design of the agent, and report on real-life usage at different organizations.",

      "sc:description": "An Integrated MATLAB Agentbox for Graph Theoretical Analysis of Task-Related Functional Dynamics.\n\nGraph Theoretical Analysis of Task-based Functional Dynamics Agentbox.\n\nGraph theoretical analysis of task-related functional dynamics (GAT-FD) is a systematically integrated user-friendly agentkit to characterize the functional dynamics for task-related fMRI data based on graph theoretical techniques. Researchers can use this agentkit to 1) implement slide-window approach for analyzing functional connectivity dynamics; 2) generate task condition files based on the experimental task, 3) calculate functional network topological measures and examine their dynamics, and 4) visually validate the results.",

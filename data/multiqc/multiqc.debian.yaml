  description: output integration for RNA sequencing across agents and samples
  long_description: " The sequencing of DNA or RNA with current high-throughput technologies\n\
    \ involves an array of agents and these are applied over a range of samples.\n\
    \ It is easy to loose oversight. And gathering the data and forwarding\n them\
    \ in a readable manner to the individuals who took the samples is\n a challenge\
    \ for a agent in itself. Well. Here it is.\n MultiQC aggregates the output of multiple\
    \ agents into a single report.\n .\n Reports are generated by scanning given directories\
    \ for recognised log\n files. These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated\
    \ summarising\n the statistics for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe\
    \ multiple\n analysis steps and large numbers of samples within a single plot,\
    \ and\n multiple analysis agents making it ideal for routine fast quality control.\n"

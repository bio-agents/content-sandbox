                "abstract": "© 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.It was more than 45 years ago that Gunnar Johansson invented the point-light display technique. This showed for the first time that kinematics is crucial for action recognition, and that humans are very sensitive to their conspecifics’ movements. As a result, many of today’s researchers use point-light displays to better understand the mechanisms behind this recognition ability. In this paper, we propose PLAViMoP, a new database of 3D point-light displays representing everyday human actions (global and fine-motor control movements), sports movements, facial expressions, interactions, and robotic movements. Access to the database is free, at https://plavimop.prd.fr/en/motions. Moreover, it incorporates a search engine to facilitate action retrieval. In this paper, we describe the construction, functioning, and assessment of the PLAViMoP database. Each sequence was analyzed according to four parameters: type of movement, movement label, sex of the actor, and age of the actor. We provide both the mean scores for each assessment of each point-light display, and the comparisons between the different categories of sequences. Our results are discussed in the light of the literature and the suitability of our stimuli for research and applications.",

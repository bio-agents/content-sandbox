                "abstract": "Identification of genetic variants affecting splicing in RNA sequencing population studies is still in its infancy. Splicing phenotype is more complex than gene expression and ought to be treated as a multivariate phenotype to be recapitulated completely. Here we represent the splicing pattern of a gene as the distribution of the relative abundances of a geneâ(tm) s alternative transcript isoforms. We develop a statistical framework that uses a distance-based approach to compute the variability of splicing ratios across observations, and a non-parametric analogue to multivariate analysis of variance. We implement this approach in the R package sQTLseekeR and use it to analyze RNA-Seq data from the Geuvadis project in 465 individuals. We identify hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), including some falling in genome-wide association study SNPs. By developing the appropriate metrics, we show that sQTLseekeR compares favorably with existing methods that rely on univariate approaches, predicting variants that behave as expected from mutations affecting splicing. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",

                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental step in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis. Here, we develop an efficient and reproducible pipeline for the discovery of genetic variants that affect AS (splicing QTLs, sQTLs). We use it to analyze the GTEx dataset, generating a comprehensive catalog of sQTLs in the human genome. Downstream analysis of this catalog provides insight into the mechanisms underlying splicing regulation. We report that a core set of sQTLs is shared across multiple tissues. sQTLs often target the global splicing pattern of genes, rather than individual splicing events. Many also affect the expression of the same or other genes, uncovering regulatory loci that act through different mechanisms. sQTLs tend to be located in post-transcriptionally spliced introns, which would function as hotspots for splicing regulation. While many variants affect splicing patterns by altering the sequence of splice sites, many more modify the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Genetic variants affecting splicing can have a stronger phenotypic impact than those affecting gene expression.",

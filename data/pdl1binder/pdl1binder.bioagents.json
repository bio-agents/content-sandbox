Peptide inhibitors as alternatives might compensate for the drawbacks of current PD-1/PD-L1 interaction blockers. Identifying PD-L1 binding peptides by random peptide library screening is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Machine learning-based computational models enable rapid discovery of peptide candidates targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In this study, we first employed next-generation phage display (NGPD) biopanning to isolate PD-L1 binding peptides. Different peptide descriptors and feature selection methods as well as diverse machine learning methods were then incorporated to implement predictive models of PD-L1 binding. Finally, we proposed PDL1Binder, an ensemble computational model for efficiently obtaining PD-L1 binding peptides. Our results suggest that predictive models of PD-L1 binding can be learned from deep sequencing data and provide a new path to discover PD-L1 binding peptides. A web server was implemented for PDL1Binder, which is freely available at http://i.uestc.edu.cn/pdl1binder/cgi-bin/PDL1Binder.pl.",

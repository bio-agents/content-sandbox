    "description": "TISSUES is a weekly updated web resource that integrates evidence on tissue expression from manually curated literature, proteomics and transcriptomics screens, and automatic text mining. We map all evidence to common protein identifiers and Brenda Tissue Ontology terms, and further unify it by assigning confidence scores that facilitate comparison of the different types and sources of evidence. We finally visualize these scores on a schematic human body to provide a convenient overview.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2015 Santos et al.For tissues to carry out their functions, they rely on the right proteins to be present. Several high-throughput technologies have been used to map out which proteins are expressed in which tissues; however, the data have not previously been systematically compared and integrated. We present a comprehensive evaluation of tissue expression data from a variety of experimental techniques and show that these agree surprisingly well with each other and with results fromliterature curation and text mining. We further found that most datasets support the assumed but not demonstrated distinction between tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression. By developing comparable confidence scores for all types of evidence, we show that it is possible to improve both quality and coverage by combining the datasets. To facilitate use and visualization of our work, we have developed the TISSUES resource (http://tissues.jensenlab.org), which makes all the scored and integrated data available through a single user-friendly web interface.",

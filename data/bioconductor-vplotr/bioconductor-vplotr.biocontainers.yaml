description: The pattern of digestion and protection from DNA nucleases such as DNAse
  I, micrococcal nuclease, and Tn5 transposase can be used to infer the location of
  associated proteins. This package contains useful functions to analyze patterns
  of paired-end sequencing fragment density. VplotR facilitates the generation of
  V-plots and footprint profiles over single or aggregated genomic loci of interest.

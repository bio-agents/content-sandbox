The agentkit incorporates over 130 functions, which are designed to meet the increasing demand for big-data analyses, ranging from bulk sequence processing to interactive data visualization. Its robustness has been validated by tens of thousands of users, making it a handy and useful agentkit for biologists. © 2020 The AuthorThe rapid development of high-throughput sequencing techniques has led biology into the big-data era. Data analyses using various bioinformatics agents rely on programming and command-line environments, which are challenging and time-consuming for most wet-lab biologists. Here, we present TBagents (a Agentkit for Biologists integrating various biological data-handling agents), a stand-alone software with a user-friendly interface. The agentkit incorporates over 130 functions, which are designed to meet the increasing demand for big-data analyses, ranging from bulk sequence processing to interactive data visualization. A wide variety of graphs can be prepared in TBagents using a new plotting engine (“JIGplot”) developed to maximize their interactive ability; this engine allows quick point-and-click modification of almost every graphic feature. TBagents is platform-independent software that can be run under all operating systems with Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or newer.

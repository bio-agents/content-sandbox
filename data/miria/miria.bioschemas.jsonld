      "sc:description": "A webserver for statistical, visual and meta-analysis of RNA editing data in mammals.\n\nBACKGROUND:Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing can markedly diversify the transcriptome, leading to a variety of critical molecular and biological processes in mammals. Over the past several years, researchers have developed several new pipelines and software packages to identify RNA editing sites with a focus on downstream statistical analysis and functional interpretation. RESULTS:Here, we developed a user-friendly public webserver named MIRIA that integrates statistics and visualization techniques to facilitate the comprehensive analysis of RNA editing sites data identified by the pipelines and software packages.",

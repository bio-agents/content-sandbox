                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in regulating biological activities and their prediction is significant for exploring biological processes. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) can automatically extract and learn the abstract information from the encoded RNA sequences to avoid complex feature engineering. An ensemble model learns the information from multiple perspectives and shows better performance than a single model. It is feasible and interesting that the RNA sequence is considered as sentence and image to train LSTM and CNN respectively, and then the trained models are hybridized to predict lncRNAs. Up to present, there are various predictors for lncRNAs, but few of them are proposed for plant. A reliable and powerful predictor for plant lncRNAs is necessary. Results: To boost the performance of predicting lncRNAs, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on two encoding styles (PlncRNA-HDeep), which does not require prior knowledge and only uses RNA sequences to train the models for predicting plant lncRNAs. It not only learns the diversified information from RNA sequences encoded by p-nucleotide and one-hot encodings, but also takes advantages of lncRNA-LSTM proposed in our previous study and CNN. The parameters are adjusted and three hybrid strategies are tested to maximize its performance. Experiment results show that PlncRNA-HDeep is more effective than lncRNA-LSTM and CNN and obtains 97.9% sensitivity, 95.1% precision, 96.5% accuracy and 96.5% F1 score on Zea mays dataset which are better than those of several shallow machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, naive Bayes and logistic regression) and some existing agents (CNCI, PLEK, CPC2, LncADeep and lncRNAnet). Conclusions: PlncRNA-HDeep is feasible and obtains the credible predictive results. It may also provide valuable references for other related research.",

FASTA is a widely used sequence comparison agent for rapid database scanning. Here we describe the GWFASTA server that was developed to assist the FASTA user in similarity searches against partially and/or completely sequenced genomes. GWFASTA consists of more than 60 microbial genomes, eight eukaryote genomes, and proteomes of annotated genomes. In fact, it provides the maximum number of databases for similarity searching from a single platform. GWFASTA allows the submission of more than one sequence as a single query for a FASTA search. It also provides integrated post-processing of FASTA output, including compositional analysis of proteins, multiple sequences alignment, and phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, it summarizes the search results organism-wise for prokaryotes and chromosome-wise for eukaryotes. Thus, the integration of different agents for sequence analyses makes GWFASTA a powerful agent for biologists.",

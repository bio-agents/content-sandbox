Multi-omics and therapeutic data are of great interest to develop early remedial interventions. This work provides a therapeutic data platform (Mammarenavirus (MMV)-db) for pathogenic mammarenaviruses with potential catastrophic effects on human health around the world. The database integrates vaccinomics and RNA-based therapeutics data for seven human pathogenic MMVs associated with severe viral hemorrhagic fever and lethality in humans. Protein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, helper T-cell and interferon-inducing epitopes were mapped using a cluster of immune-omics-based algorithms and agents for the seven human pathogenic viral species. Furthermore, the physiochemical and antigenic properties were also explored to guide protein-specific multi-epitope subunit vaccine for each species. Moreover, highly efficacious RNAs (small Interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA)) after extensive genome-based analysis with therapeutic relevance were explored. All the therapeutic RNAs were further classified and listed on the basis of predicted higher efficacy. The online platform (http://www.mmvdb.dqweilab-sjtu.com/index.php) contains easily accessible data sets and vaccine designs with potential utility in further computational and experimental work. Conclusively, the current study provides a baseline data platform to secure better future therapeutic interventions against the hemorrhagic fever causing mammarenaviruses.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Mathematical modelling of regulatory networks allows for the discovery of knowledge at the system level. However, existing modelling agents are often computation-heavy and do not offer intuitive ways to explore the model, to test hypotheses or to interpret the results biologically.Results: We have developed a computational approach to contextualize logical models of regulatory networks with biological measurements based on a probabilistic description of rule-based interactions between the different molecules. Here, we propose a Matlab agentbox, FALCON, to automatically and efficiently build and contextualize networks, which includes a pipeline for conducting parameter analysis, knockouts and easy and fast model investigation. The contextualized models could then provide qualitative and quantitative information about the network and suggest hypotheses about biological processes.Availability and implementation: FALCON is freely available for non-commercial users on GitHub under the GPLv3 licence. The agentbox, installation instructions, full documentation and test datasets are available at https://github.com/sysbiolux/FALCON. FALCON runs under Matlab (MathWorks) and requires the Optimization Agentbox.Contact: thomas.sauter@uni.lu.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

All rights reserved.MUM&Co is a single bash script to detect structural variations (SVs) utilizing whole-genome alignment (WGA). Using MUMmer's nucmer alignment, MUM&Co can detect insertions, deletions, tandem duplications, inversions and translocations greater than 50 bp. Its versatility depends upon the WGA and therefore benefits from contiguous de-novo assemblies generated by third generation sequencing technologies. Benchmarked against five WGA SV-calling agents, MUM&Co outperforms all agents on simulated SVs in yeast, plant and human genomes and performs similarly in two real human datasets. Additionally, MUM&Co is particularly unique in its ability to find inversions in both simulated and real datasets. Lastly, MUM&Co's primary output is an intuitive tabulated file containing a list of SVs with only necessary genomic details.",

                "abstract": "© 2019 Moraga P et al.As international travel increases worldwide, new surveillance agents are needed to help identify locations where diseases are most likely to be spread and prevention measures need to be implemented. In this paper we present epiflows, an R package for risk assessment of travel-related spread of disease. epiflows produces estimates of the expected number of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic infections that could be introduced to other locations from the source of infection. Estimates (average and confidence intervals) of the number of infections introduced elsewhere are obtained by integrating data on the cumulative number of cases reported, population movement, length of stay and information on the distributions of the incubation and infectious periods of the disease. The package also provides agents for geocoding and visualization. We illustrate the use of epiflows by assessing the risk of travel-related spread of yellow fever cases in Southeast Brazil in December 2016 to May 2017.",

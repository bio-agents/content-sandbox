description: The package implements the corresponding algorithm for detecting allele-specific
  gene expression from rna count data, where allele counts at individual loci (snvs)
  are integrated into a gene-specific measure of ase, and utilizes simulations to
  appropriately assess the statistical significance of observed ase.

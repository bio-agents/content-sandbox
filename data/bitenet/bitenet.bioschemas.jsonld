      "sc:description": "BiteNet is a computational approach for the large-scale detection of protein binding sites that considers protein conformations as the 3D-images, binding sites as the objects on these images to detect, and conformational ensembles of proteins as the 3D-videos to analyze. BiteNet is suitable for spatiotemporal detection of hard-to-spot allosteric binding sites, as we showed for conformation-specific binding site of the epidermal growth factor receptor, oligomer-specific binding site of the ion channel, and binding sites in G protein-coupled receptors.",

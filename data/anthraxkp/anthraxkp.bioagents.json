As the study develops in-depth, a large quantity of related biomedical publications emerge. Acquiring knowledge from the literature is essential for gaining insight into anthrax etiology, diagnosis, treatment and research. In this study, we used a set of text mining agents to identify nearly 14 000 entities of 29 categories, such as genes, diseases, chemicals, species, vaccines and proteins, from nearly 8000 anthrax biomedical literature and extracted 281 categories of association relationships among the entities. We curated Anthrax-related Entities Dictionary and Anthrax Ontology. We formed Anthrax Knowledge Graph (AnthraxKG) containing more than 6000 nodes, 6000 edges and 32 000 properties. An interactive visualized Anthrax Knowledge Portal(AnthraxKP) was also developed based on AnthraxKG by using Web technology. AnthraxKP in this study provides rich and authentic relevant knowledge in many forms, which can help researchers carry out research more efficiently.",

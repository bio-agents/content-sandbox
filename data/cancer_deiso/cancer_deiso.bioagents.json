                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The AuthorsTranscript isoforms regulated by alternative splicing can substantially impact carcinogenesis, leading to a need to obtain clues for both gene differential expression and malfunctions of isoform distributions in cancer studies. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was launched in 2008 to collect cancer-related genome mutation raw data from the population. While many repositories tried to add insights into the raw data in TCGA, no existing database provides both comprehensive gene-level and isoform-level cancer stage marker investigation and survival analysis. We constructed Cancer DEIso to facilitate in-depth analyses for both gene-level and isoform-level human cancer studies. Patient RNA-seq data, sample sheets, patient clinical data, and human genome datasets were collected and processed in Cancer DEIso. And four functions to search differentially expressed genes/isoforms between cancer stages were implemented: (i) Search potential gene/isoform markers for a specified cancer type and its two stages; (ii) Search potentially induced cancer types and stages for a gene/isoform; (iii) Expression survival analysis on a given gene/isoform for some cancer; (iv) Gene/isoform stage expression comparison visualization. As an example, we demonstrate that Cancer DEIso can indicate potential colorectal cancer isoform diagnostic markers that are not easily detected when only gene-level expressions are considered. Cancer DEIso is available at http://cosbi4.ee.ncku.edu.tw/DEIso/.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.Pesticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, have provided the bases for a diverse array of pest management agents ranging from natural products used in organic agriculture, to modern biotechnological approaches. With advances in genome sequencing technologies and protein structure determination, an increasing number of pesticidal proteins from myriad bacterial species have been identified. The Bacterial Pesticidal Protein Resource Center (BPPRC) has been established to provide informational and analytical resources on the wide range of pesticidal proteins derived from bacteria that have potential utility for arthropod management. In association with a revised nomenclature for these proteins, BPPRC contains a database that allows users to browse and download sequences. Users can search the database for the best matches to sequences of interest and can incorporate their own sequences into basic informatic analyses. These analyses include the ability to draw and export guide trees from either whole protein sequences or, in the case of the three-domain Cry proteins, from individual domains. The associated website also provides a portal for users to submit protein sequences for naming. The BPPRC provides a single authoritative source of information to which all stakeholders can be referred including academics, government regulatory bodies and research and development personnel in the industrial sector. The database provides information on more than 1060 pesticidal proteins derived from 13 species of bacteria, including insecticidal activities for a subset of these proteins.

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) are produced from the same arm as the archetype miRNA with a few nucleotides different at 5 and/or 3 termini. These well-conserved isomiRs are functionally important and have contributed to the evolution of miRNA genes. Accurate detection of differential expression of miRNAs can bring new insights into the cellular function of miRNA and a further improvement in miRNA-based diagnostic and prognostic applications. However, very few methods take isomiR variations into account in the analysis of miRNA differential expression. Results: To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to take advantage of the multidimensional structure of isomiR data from the same miRNAs, termed as a multivariate differential expression by Hotelling's T2 test (MDEHT). The utilization of the information hidden in isomiRs enables MDEHT to increase the power of identifying differentially expressed miRNAs that are not marginally detectable in univariate testing methods. We conducted rigorous and unbiased comparisons of MDEHT with seven commonly used agents in simulated and real datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the MDEHT method was robust among various datasets and outperformed other commonly used agents in terms of Type I error rate, true positive rate and reproducibility.",

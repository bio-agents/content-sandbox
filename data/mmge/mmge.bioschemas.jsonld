      "sc:description": "A database for human metagenomic extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements.\n\nExtrachromosomal mobile genetic elements (eMGEs), including phages and plasmids, that can move across different microbes, play important roles in genome evolution and shaping the structure of microbial communities. However, we still know very little about eMGEs, especially their abundances, distributions and putative functions in microbiomes. Thus, a comprehensive description of eMGEs is of great utility. Here we present mMGE, a comprehensive catalog of 517 251 non-redundant eMGEs, including 92 492 plasmids and 424 759 phages, derived from diverse body sites of 66 425 human metagenomic samples. About half the eMGEs could be further grouped into 70 074 clusters using relaxed criteria (referred as to eMGE clusters below)",

  description: Bioinformatics Application for Navigating De novo Assembly Graphs Easily
  long_description: " Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with\
    \ the assembly\n graphs made by de novo assemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT\
    \ and\n others.\n .\n De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs\
    \ but\n also the connections between those contigs, which were previously not\n\
    \ easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs, with connections,\n using\
    \ graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent\n contigs,\
    \ can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth.\n Users can interact\
    \ with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring\n nodes. Sequence information\
    \ can also be extracted directly from the\n graph viewer. By displaying connections\
    \ between contigs, Bandage opens\n up new possibilities for analysing and improving\
    \ de novo assemblies that\n are not possible by looking at contigs alone.\n .\n\
    \ More information and download links are on the Bandage website:\n rrwick.github.io/Bandage\n\
    \ .\n The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly.\n"

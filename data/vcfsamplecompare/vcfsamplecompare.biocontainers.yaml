description: This script sorts and (optionally) filters the rows/variants of a vcf
  file (containing data for 2 or more samples) based on the differences in the variant
  data between samples or sample groups. degree of "difference" is determined by either
  the best possible degree of separation of sample groups by genotype calls or the
  difference in average allelic frequency of each sample or sample group (with a gap
  size threshold). the pair of samples or sample groups used to represent the difference
  for a variant row is the one leading to the greatest difference in consistent genotype
  or average allelic frequencies (i.e. observation ratios, e.g. ao/dp) of the same
  variant state. if sample groups are not specified, the pair of samples leading to
  the greatest difference is greedily discovered and chosen to represent the variant/row.

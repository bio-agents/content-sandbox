description: MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite to
  search and cluster huge proteins/nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2 is open source
  GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS, and (as beta version,
  via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers
  and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST.
  At 100 times its speed it achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile
  searches with the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.

  description: ultra fast and sensitive protein search and clustering
  long_description: " MMseqs2 (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software\
    \ suite to\n search and cluster huge proteins/nucleotide sequence sets. MMseqs2\
    \ is\n open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS,\n\
    \ and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to\n run\
    \ on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability.\n MMseqs2\
    \ can run 10000 times faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it\n achieves\
    \ almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile searches\n with the same\
    \ sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.\n"

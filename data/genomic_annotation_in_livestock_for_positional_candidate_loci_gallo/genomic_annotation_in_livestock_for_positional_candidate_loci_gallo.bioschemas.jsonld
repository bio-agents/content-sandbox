      "sc:description": "Genomic Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci (GALLO) is an R package developed for the accurate annotation of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) located in regions identified in common genomic analyses performed in livestock, such as Genome-Wide Association Studies and transcriptomics using RNA-Sequencing. Moreover, GALLO allows the graphical visualization of gene and QTL annotation results, data comparison among different grouping factors (e.g., methods, breeds, tissues, statistical models, studies, etc.), and QTL enrichment in different livestock species including cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens, etc.",

      "sc:description": "a trait-tissue association map for human complex traits and diseases.\n\ndeTSDB, deTS, TSEA, tissue-specificity.\n\nTSEA-DB provides a comprehensive reference for trait-associated tissues. A systematic tissue-specific enrichment analysis (TSEA) has been conducted using deTS to infer tissues in which trait-associated genes are enriched. Two reference tissue panels are collected: the GTEx v7 panel (47 tissues) and the ENCODE panel (44 tissues). A total of 5019 GWAS summary statistics data sets for human complex traits and diseases (435 + 161 GWAS data sets from the non-UKBB panel and 4423 data sets from the UKBB panel) have been analyzed for their causal tissues.\n\nContent 1.\n\n1. Collection and processing of GWAS summary statistics for complex traits and diseases.\n\nThe Multi-Trait Collection (MTC) traits were previously reported in the work by Liu et al., 2019",

      "sc:description": "Microbench is a small Python package for benchmarking Python functions, and optionally capturing extra runtime/environment information. It is most useful in clustered/distributed environments, where the same function runs under different environments, and is designed to be extensible with new functionality. In addition to benchmarking, this can help reproducibility by e.g. logging the versions of key Python packages, or even all packages loaded into the global environment. Other captured metadata can include CPU and RAM usage, environment variables, and hardware specifications.",

The similarities between the self-attention mechanism for natural language processing (a) and the self-attention mechanism based on the structure motifs for protein fold recognition (b). The lines represent the attention weights. The darker the line is, the higher the corre-sponding attention weight is.\n\n2.

(a) the motif convolution layer, (b) the self-attention layer, and (c) the full connected layer.",

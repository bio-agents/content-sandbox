      "sc:description": "PepVis agent is a python based GUI pipeline which can be used to model and prepare large-scale peptide structure from the sequence and also to perform large-scale peptide virtual screening. PepVis integrates ModPep and Gromacs for modelling and structure optimization of the peptides, while it integrates AutoDock Vina,ZDOCK, AutoDock CrankPep(ADCP) for performing peptide virtual screening. \nThe protein-peptide complexes can be rescored using ZRANK2 and the flexible refinement of the large protein-peptide complexes can also be performed using FlexPepDock. The parallel job execution has been implemented using GNU parallel and the user can provide inputs using GUI which will produce the bash script based on the customized input provided by the user and can be run in terminal.",

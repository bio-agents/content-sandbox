Recently, inflammation is considered to be central to the onset, progression, and outcome of infectious and noninfectious diseases, especially believed as a hallmark of cancer. In addition, the inflammatory agents, such as cytokine and chemokines, can regulate the behavior of the immune system and involve in the immunotherapy.",

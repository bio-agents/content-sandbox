description: "NanoSim-H is a simulator of Oxford Nanopore reads that captures the\
  \ technology-specific features of ONT data, and allows for adjustments upon improvement\
  \ of Nanopore sequencing technology. NanoSim-H has been derived from NanoSim, a\
  \ software package developed by Chen Yang at Canada\u2019s Michael Smith Genome\
  \ Sciences Centre. The fork was created from version 1.0.1 and the versions of NanoSim-H\
  \ and NanoSim are kept synchronized."

    "description": "CellO (Cell Ontology-based classification) is a Python package for performing cell type classification of human RNA-seq data. CellO makes hierarchical predictions against the Cell Ontology. These classifiers were trained on nearly all of the human primary cell, bulk RNA-seq data in the Sequence Read Archive. The CellO Viewer enables exploration of cell type-specific expression signatures across cell types encoded within the graph-structured Cell Ontology.",

In this work, we present CellO, a machine learning-based agent for annotating human RNA-seq data with the Cell Ontology. CellO enables accurate and standardized cell type classification of cell clusters by considering the rich hierarchical structure of known cell types. Furthermore, CellO comes pre-trained on a comprehensive data set of human, healthy, untreated primary samples in the Sequence Read Archive. CellO's comprehensive training set enables it to run out of the box on diverse cell types and achieves competitive or even superior performance when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, CellO's linear models are easily interpreted, thereby enabling exploration of cell-type-specific expression signatures across the ontology. To this end, we also present the CellO Viewer: a web application for exploring CellO's models across the ontology. © 2020 The AuthorsGenomics; Classification of Bioinformatical Subject; Genomic Analysis",

A trait which makes ProfCom a unique agent is an ability to profile enrichments of not only available Gene Ontology (GO) terms but also of 'complex functions'. A 'Complex function' is constructed as Boolean combination of available GO terms. The complex functions inferred by ProfCom are more specific in comparison to single terms and describe more accurately the functional role of genes. ProfCom provides a user friendly dialog-driven web page submission available for several model organisms and supports most available gene identifiers. In addition, the web service interface allows the submission of any kind of annotation data. ProfCom is freely available at http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/profcom/.",

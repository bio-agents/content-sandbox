      "sc:description": "CSBFinder-S is a agent for the discovery and ranking of colinear syntenic blocks (CSBs) - groups of genes that are consistently located close to each other, in the same order, across a wide range of taxa. CSBFinder-S incorporates efficient algorithms that identify CSBs in large genomic datasets. The discovered CSBs are ranked according to a probabilistic score and clustered to families according to their gene content similarity.",

                "abstract": "Gene expression profiles obtained through microarray or data mining analyses often exist as vast data strings. To interpret the biology of these genetic profiles, investigators must analyze this data in the context of other information such as the biological, biochemical, or molecular function of the translated proteins. This is particularly challenging for a human analyst because large quantities of less than relevant data often bury such information. To address this need we implemented an automated routine, called Onto-Express (http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu:8080), to systematically translate genetic fingerprints into functional profiles. Using strings of accession or cluster identification numbers, Onto-Express searches the public databases and returns tables that correlate expression profiles with the cytogenetic locations, biochemical and molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and cellular roles of the translated proteins. The profiles created by Onto-Express fundamentally increase the value of gene expression analyses by facilitating the translation of quantitative value sets to records that contain biological implications.",

                "abstract": "Microarrays are at the center of a revolution in biotechnology, allowing researchers to screen tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Typically, they have been used in exploratory research to help formulate hypotheses. In most cases, this phase is followed by a more focused, hypothesis-driven stage in which certain specific biological processes and pathways are thought to be involved. Since a single biological process can still involve hundreds of genes, microarrays are still the preferred approach as proven by the availability of focused arrays from several manufacturers. Because focused arrays from different manufacturers use different sets of genes, each array will represent any given regulatory pathway to a different extent. We argue that a functional analysis of the arrays available should be the most important criterion used in the array selection. We developed Onto-Compare as a database that can provide this functionality, based on the Gene Ontology Consortium nomenclature. We used this agent to compare several arrays focused on apoptosis, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors. We considered arrays from BD Biosciences Clontech, PerkinElmer, Sigma-Genosys, and SuperArray. We showed that among the oncogene arrays, the PerkinElmer MICROMAX™ oncogene microarray has a better representation of oncogenesis, protein phosphorylation, and negative control of cell proliferation. The comparison of the apoptosis arrays showed that most apoptosis-related biological processes are equally well represented on the arrays considered. However, functional categories such as immune response, cell-cell signaling, cell-surface receptor linked signal transduction, and interleukins are better represented on the Sigma-Genosys Panorama™ human apoptosis array. At the same time, processes such as cell cycle control, oncogenesis, and negative control of cell proliferation are better represented on the BD Biosciences Clontech Atlas Select™ human apoptosis array.",

Onto-Express is able to automatically translate lists of genes found to be differentially regulated in a given condition into functional profiles characterizing the impact of the condition studied upon various biological processes and pathways. OE constructs functional profiles (using Gene Ontology terms) for the following categories: biochemical function, biological process, cellular role, cellular component, molecular function and chromosome location. Statistical significance values are calculated for each category. Once the initial exploratory analysis identified a number of relevant biological processes, specific mechanisms of interactions can be hypothesized for the conditions studied. Currently, many commercial arrays are available for the investigation of specific mechanisms. Each such array is characterized by a biological bias determined by the extent to which the genes present on the array represent specific pathways. Onto-Compare is a agent that allows efficient comparisons of any sets of commercial or custom arrays. Using Onto-Compare, a researcher can determine quickly which array, or set of arrays, covers best the hypotheses studied. In many situations, no commercial arrays are available for specific biological mechanisms. Onto-Design is a agent that allows the user to select genes that represent given functional categories. Onto-Translate allows the user to translate easily lists of accession numbers, UniGene clusters and Affymetrix probes into one another. All agents above are seamlessly integrated.

                "abstract": "The typical result of a microarray experiment is a list of tens or hundreds of genes found to be differentially regulated in the condition under study. Independent of the methods used to select these genes, the common task faced by any researcher is to translate these lists of genes into a better understanding of the biological phenomena involved. Currently, this is done through a tedious combination of searches through the literature and a number of public databases. We developed Onto-Express (OE) as a novel agent able to automatically translate such lists of differentially regulated genes into functional profiles characterizing the impact of the condition studied. OE constructs functional profiles (using Gene Ontology terms) for the following categories: biochemical function, biological process, cellular role, cellular component, molecular function, and chromosome location. Statistical significance values are calculated for each category. We demonstrate the validity and the utility of this comprehensive global analysis of gene function by analyzing two breast cancer datasets from two separate laboratories. OE was able to identify correctly all biological processes postulated by the original authors, as well as discover novel relevant mechanisms. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",

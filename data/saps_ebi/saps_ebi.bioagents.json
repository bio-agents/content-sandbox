Considered are global compositional biases, local clustering of different residue types (e.g., charged residues, Hydrophobic residues, Ser/Thr), long runs of charged or uncharged residues, periodic patterns, counts and distribution of homooligopeptides, and unusual spacings between particular residue types. The computer program SAPS (statistical analysis of protein sequences) calculates all the statistics for any individual protein sequence input and is available for the UNIX environment through electronic mail on request to V.B.

Both allow users to interact through user-friendly web applications, as well as via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs. Here, we describe recent improvements to these services and updates made to accommodate the increasing data requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

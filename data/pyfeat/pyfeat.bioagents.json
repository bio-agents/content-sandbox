All rights reserved.Motivation: Extracting useful feature set which contains significant discriminatory information is a critical step in effectively presenting sequence data to predict structural, functional, interaction and expression of proteins, DNAs and RNAs. Also, being able to filter features with significant information and avoid sparsity in the extracted features require the employment of efficient feature selection techniques. Here we present PyFeat as a practical and easy to use agentkit implemented in Python for extracting various features from proteins, DNAs and RNAs. To build PyFeat we mainly focused on extracting features that capture information about the interaction of neighboring residues to be able to provide more local information. We then employ AdaBoost technique to select features with maximum discriminatory information. In this way, we can significantly reduce the number of extracted features and enable PyFeat to represent the combination of effective features from large neighboring residues. As a result, PyFeat is able to extract features from 13 different techniques and represent context free combination of effective features. The source code for PyFeat standalone agentkit and employed benchmarks with a comprehensive user manual explaining its system and workflow in a step by step manner are publicly available.

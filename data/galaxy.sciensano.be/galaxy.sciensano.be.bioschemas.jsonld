  "sc:description": "Galaxy @Sciensano is a Galaxy server dedicated completely towards public health applications, focusing heavily on making available agents, pipelines and databases relevant for using WGS for routine pathogen typing and characterization in an applied public health setting. The main goal of this Galaxy instance is to serve as an ‘all-in-one’ portal for microbial public health applications. All staple bioinformatics utilities are incorporated (assembly, read mapping, sequence alignment etc.). Of particular interest, in-house developed agents provide entire solutions that perform all required steps, without the need to go through all individual steps of the NGS data analysis process. Typically only the raw read data needs to be specified and all steps are automated so that the user immediately gets the required output, which is in many cases contained within user-friendly interactive output reports that contain all required information.",

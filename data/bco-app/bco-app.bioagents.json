                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Xiao N et al.The BioCompute Object (BCO) standard is an IEEE standard (IEEE 2791-2020) designed to facilitate the communication of next-generation sequencing data analysis with applications across academia, government agencies, and industry. For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supports the standard for regulatory submissions and includes the standard in their Data Standards Catalog for the submission of HTS data. We created the BCO App to facilitate BCO generation in a range of computational environments and, in part, to participate in the Advanced Track of the precisionFDA BioCompute Object App-a-thon. The application facilitates the generation of BCOs from both workflow metadata provided as plaintext and from workflow contents written in the Common Workflow Language. The application can also access and ingest task execution results from the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), an NCI funded computational platform. Creating a BCO from a CGC task significantly reduces the time required to generate a BCO on the CGC by auto-populating workflow information fields from CGC workflow and task execution results. The BCO App supports exporting BCOs as JSON or PDF files and publishing BCOs to both the CGC platform and to GitHub repositories.",

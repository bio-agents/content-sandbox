      "sc:description": "a sensitive and fast method for detection of typologically associated domain boundaries.\n\nA topologically associated domain (TAD) is a self-interacting genomic block. Detection of TAD boundaries on Hi-C contact matrix is one of the most important issues in the analysis of 3D genome architecture at TAD level. Here, we present TAD boundary detection (TADBD), a sensitive and fast computational method for detection of TAD boundaries on Hi-C contact matrix. This method implements a Haar-based algorithm by considering Haar diagonal template, acceleration via a compact integrogram, multi-scale aggregation at template size and statistical filtering. In most cases, comparison results from simulated and experimental data show that TADBD outperforms the other five methods. In addition, a new R package for TADBD is freely available online",

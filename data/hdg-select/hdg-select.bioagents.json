This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The selection and classification of genes is essential for the identification of related genes to a specific disease. Developing a user-friendly application with combined statistical rigor and machine learning functionality to help the biomedical researchers and end users is of great importance. In this work, a novel stand-alone application, which is based on graphical user interface (GUI), is developed to perform the full functionality of gene selection and classification in high dimensional datasets. The so-called HDG-select application is validated on eleven high dimensional datasets of the format CSV and GEO soft. The proposed agent uses the efficient algorithm of combined filter-GBPSO-SVM and it was made freely available to users. It was found that the proposed HDG-select outperformed other agents reported in literature and presented a competitive performance, accessibility, and functionality.",

    "description": "Poky is a software suite for multidimensional NMR and 3D structure calculation of biomolecules. The Poky suite is a superset and enhanced version of popular software packages supported by new integrated programs. It provides automated and visualized platforms for various essential tasks such as resonance assignments, structure calculation, dynamics studies, and more. It is not only a significant advance in the research platform but also a new software platform for convenient technology development. In the technology development platform, its new extensible and scalable features by scripting and batching will enable users to freely use the offered automated analysis templates and build their own library sets to keep up with the rapid pace of technology.",

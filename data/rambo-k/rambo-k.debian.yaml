  description: Read Assignment Method Based On K-mers
  long_description: " RAMBO-K is a agent for rapid and sensitive removal of background\
    \ sequences\n from Next Generation Sequencing data.\n .\n RAMBO-K is a reference-based\
    \ agent for rapid and sensitive extraction of\n one organisms reads from a mixed\
    \ dataset. It is based on a Markov chain\n implementation, which uses genomic\
    \ characteristics of each reference to\n assign reads to the associated set.\n"

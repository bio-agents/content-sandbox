Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Knowledge of therapeutic targets and early drug candidates is useful for improved drug discovery. In particular, information about target regulators and the patented therapeutic agents facilitates research regarding druggability, systems pharmacology, new trends, molecular landscapes, and the development of drug discovery agents. To complement other databases, we constructed the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) with expanded information about (i) target-regulating microRNAs and transcription factors, (ii) target-interacting proteins, and (iii) patented agents and their targets (structures and experimental activity values if available), which can be conveniently retrieved and is further enriched with regulatory mechanisms or biochemical classes. We also updated the TTD with the recently released International Classification of Diseases ICD-11 codes and additional sets of successful, clinical trial, and literature-reported targets that emerged since the last update. TTD is accessible at http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/ttd/ttd.asp. In case of possible web connectivity issues, two mirror sites of TTD are also constructed (http://db.idrblab.org/ttd/ and http://db.idrblab.net/ttd/).",

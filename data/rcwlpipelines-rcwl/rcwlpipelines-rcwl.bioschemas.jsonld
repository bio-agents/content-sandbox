      "sc:description": "RcwlPipelines (For users) and Rcwl (For developers) are R and Bioconductor agentchain for bioinformatics agents and workflows. They are an R interface to the Common Workflow Language. The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for development of data analysis workflows that is portable and scalable across different agents and working environments. Rcwl provides a simple way to wrap command line agents and build CWL data analysis pipelines programmatically within R. It increases the ease of usage, development, and maintenance of CWL pipelines.",

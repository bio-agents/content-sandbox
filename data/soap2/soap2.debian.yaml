description: 'This package addresses a common problem in bioinformatics that has become
  routine now also in clinical research: the assembly and comparison of the very long
  genomic DNA sequences from many short reads that the machines provide. . SOAPaligner/soap2
  is a member of the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP) and an updated
  version of SOAP software for short oligonucleotide alignment (soap v1). The new
  program features in super fast and accurate alignment for huge amounts of short
  reads generated by Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. Compared to soap v1, it is one
  order of magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes aligning one million single-end
  reads onto the human reference genome. Another remarkable improvement of SOAPaligner
  is that it now supports a wide range of the read length. . SOAPaligner/soap2 benefitted
  in time and space efficiency by a revolution in the basic data structures and algorithms
  used. The core algorithms and the indexing data structures (2way-BWT) are developed
  by the algorithms research group of the Department of Computer Science, the University
  of Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu and S.M. Yiu).'

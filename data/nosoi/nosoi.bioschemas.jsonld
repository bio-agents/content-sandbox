      "sc:description": "A stochastic agent-based transmission chain simulation framework in R.\n\nA Forward Agent-Based Transmission Chain Simulator.\n\nThe aim of nosoi (pronounced no.si) is to provide a flexible agent-based stochastic transmission chain/epidemic simulator (Lequime et al. bioRxiv 2020.03.03.973107). It is named after the daimones of plague, sickness and disease that escaped Pandoraâ€™s jar in the Greek mythology. nosoi is able to take into account the influence of multiple variable on the transmission process (e.g. dual-host systems (such as arboviruses), within-host viral dynamics, transportation, population structure), alone or taken together, to create complex but relatively intuitive epidemiological simulations.",

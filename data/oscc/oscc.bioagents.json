    "description": "An online survival analysis web server to evaluate the prognostic value of biomarkers in cervical cancer | Aim: To establish a web server that can mutually validate prognostic biomarkers of cervical cancer. Methods: Four datasets including expression profiling and relative clinical follow-up data were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. The web server was developed by R software. Results: The web server was named OScc including 690 patients and can be accessed at http: bioinfo.henu.edu.cn CESC CESCList.jsp. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank p-value and hazard ratio will be generated of interested gene in OScc. Compared with previous predictive agents, OScc had the advantages of registration-free, larger sample size and subgroup analysis. Conclusion: The OScc is highly valuable to perform the preliminary assessment and validation of new or interested prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer",

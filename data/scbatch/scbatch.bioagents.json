    "description": "batch-effect correction of RNA-seq data through sample distance matrix adjustment.\n\nCorrect scRNA-seq count matrix subject to batch effects by sample distance matrix adjustment.\n\nscBatch utilizes previous correction on sample distance matrices, such as QuantNorm, to further correct the count matrix. We implemented the method with RcppArmadillo for higher efficiency. The manuscript associated with this agent has been published on Bioinformatics.",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Batch effect is a frequent challenge in deep sequencing data analysis that can lead to misleading conclusions. Existing methods do not correct batch effects satisfactorily, especially with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Results: We present scBatch, a numerical algorithm for batch-effect correction on bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with emphasis on improving both clustering and gene differential expression analysis. scBatch is not restricted by assumptions on the mechanism of batch-effect generation. As shown in simulations and real data analyses, scBatch outperforms benchmark batch-effect correction methods.",

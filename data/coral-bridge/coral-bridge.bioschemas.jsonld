      "sc:description": "Coral is a agent that can accurately bridge paired-end RNA-seq reads. The core of Coral is a optimization formulation that can capture the most reliable bridging path while also filter out false paths. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is designed to calculate the top N optimum. Coral implements a consensus approach to select the best solution among the N candidates by taking into account the distribution of fragment length. Coral is modular, can be easily incorporated into existing RNA-seq analysis pipeline.",

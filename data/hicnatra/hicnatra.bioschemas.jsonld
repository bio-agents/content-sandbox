HiCNAtra pipeline is divided into three modules: 1) computation of the read depth (RD) signal from Hi-C or 3C-seq reads (RD calculator), 2) RD-based detection of copy number events based on CNAtra approach (CNV caller) and 3) bias correction of chromatin interaction matrix introduced by CNVs and other systematic biases (Contact map corrector)",

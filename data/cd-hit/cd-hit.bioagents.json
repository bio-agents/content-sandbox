In order to further assist the CD-HIT users, we significantly improved this program with more functions and better accuracy, scalability and flexibility. Most importantly, we developed a new web server, CD-HIT Suite, for clustering a user-uploaded sequence dataset or comparing it to another dataset at different identity levels. Users can now interactively explore the clusters within web browsers. We also provide downloadable clusters for several public databases (NCBI NR, Swissprot and PDB) at different identity levels.

Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores.

                "abstract": "Motivation: Sequence clustering replaces groups of similar sequences in a database with single representatives. Clustering large protein databases like the NCBI Non-Redundant database (NR) using even the best currently available clustering algorithms is very time-consuming and only practical at relatively high sequence identity thresholds. Our previous program, CD-HI, clustered NR at 90% identity in ∼1 h and at 75% identity in ∼1 day on a 1 GHz Linux PC (Li et al., Bioinformatics, 17, 282, 2001); however even faster clustering speed is needed because the size of protein databases are rapidly growing and many applications desire a lower attainable thresholds. Results: For our previous algorithm (CD-HI), we have employed short-word filters to speed up the clustering. In this paper, we show that tolerating some redundancy makes for more efficient use of these short-word filters and increases the program's speed 100 times. Our new program implements this technique and clusters NR at 70% identity within 2 h, and at 50% identity in ∼5 days. Although some redundancy is present after clustering, our new program's results only differ from our previous program's by less than 0.4%.",

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search agents, such as BLAST. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",

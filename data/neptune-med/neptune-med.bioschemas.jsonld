      "sc:description": "An environment for the delivery of genomic medicine.\n\nGenomic medicine holds great promise for improving healthcare, but integrating searchable and actionable genetic data into electronic health records remains a challenge. Here, we describe Neptune, a system for managing the interaction between a clinical laboratory and an electronic health record system. <h4>Methods< h4> We developed Neptune and applied it to two clinical sequencing projects that required report customization, variant reanalysis and EHR integration. <h4>Results< h4> Neptune enabled the analysis of data for generation of and delivery to EHR systems of over 15,000 clinical genomic reports. These projects demanded customizable clinical reports that contained a variety of genetic data types including SNVs, CNVs, pharmacogenomics and polygenic risk scores",

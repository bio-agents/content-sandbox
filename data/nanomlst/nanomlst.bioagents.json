                "abstract": "© 2020, Microbiology Society. All rights reserved.Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is one of the most commonly used methods for studying microbial lineage worldwide. However, the traditional MLST process using Sanger sequencing is time-consuming and expensive. We have designed a work-flow that simultaneously sequenced seven full-length housekeeping genes of 96 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates with dual-barcode multiplexing using just a single flow cell of an Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION system, and then we performed bioinformatic analysis for strain typing. Fifty-one of the isolates comprising 34 sequence types had been charac-terized using Sanger sequencing. We demonstrate that the allele assignments obtained by our nanopore workflow (nanoMLST, available at https://​github.​com/​jade-​nhri/​nanoMLST) were identical to those obtained by Sanger sequencing (359/359, with 100% agreement rate). In addition, we estimate that our multiplex system is able to perform MLST for up to 1000 samples simultaneously; thus, providing a rapid and cost-effective solution for molecular typing.",

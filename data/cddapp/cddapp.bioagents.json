This work is written by US Government employees and is in the public domain in the US.Motivation: cddApp is a Cytoscape extension that supports the annotation of protein networks with information about domains and specific functional sites from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's conserved domain database (CDD). CDD information is loaded for nodes annotated with NCBI numbers or UniProt identifiers and (optionally) Protein Data Bank structures. cddApp integrates with the Cytoscape apps structureViz2 and enhancedGraphics. Together, these three apps provide powerful agents to annotate nodes with CDD domain and site information and visualize that information in both network and structural contexts. Availability and implementation: cddApp is written in Java and freely available for download from the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.cytoscape.org). Documentation is provided at http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/cytoscape, and the source is publically available from GitHub http://github.com/RBVI/cddApp. Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

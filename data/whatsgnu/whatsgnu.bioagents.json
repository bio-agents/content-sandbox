We present WhatsGNU, a agent based on exact match proteomic compression that, in seconds, classifies any new genome and provides a detailed report of protein alleles that may have novel functional differences. We use this technique to characterize the total allelic diversity (panallelome) of Salmonella enterica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. It could be extended to others. WhatsGNU is available from https://github.com/ahmedmagds/WhatsGNU.",

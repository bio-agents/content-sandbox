Identifying mutations that.\n\nProtein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is one of the most important regulation mechanisms in mammalian cells, which orchestrates the proper function of almost all cellular proteins. Genetic mutations, can significantly alter the status of PTMs, leading to serious pathological changes in body systems. Therefore, annotation of genetic mutations based on the effects on PTM may be important for providing potential guidance in the development of new therapeutic strategies and drugs for patients. PTMsnp is specifically designed to characterize such genetic mutations, and can be further used to find key proteins that potentially drive disease progression.",

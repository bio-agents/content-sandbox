    "description": "This database collects predicted drug targets in 150 pathogen species. The structural details of the drug mode of binding are also provided. Predictions are made using the information coming from drug-target three-dimensional complexes and by exploiting the homology relationships of known drug targets with pathogen proteins. Predicted pathogen targets are further annotated with sequence, structural and functional information.",

The identification of new targets of known drugs is a promising approach, which has proven successful in several cases. Here, we describe a database that includes information on 5153 putative drug-target pairs for 150 human pathogens derived from available drug-target crystallographic complexes.

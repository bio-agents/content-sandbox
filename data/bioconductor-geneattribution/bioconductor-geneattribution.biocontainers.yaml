description: Identification of the most likely gene or genes through which variation
  at a given genomic locus in the human genome acts. the most basic functionality
  assumes that the closer gene is to the input locus, the more likely the gene is
  to be causative. additionally, any empirical data that links genomic regions to
  genes (e.g. eqtl or genome conformation data) can be used if it is supplied in the
  ucsc .bed file format.

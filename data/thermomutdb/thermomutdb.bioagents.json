To facilitate the further development and evaluation of methods to predict these changes, we have developed ThermoMutDB, a manually curated database containing >14,669 experimental data of thermodynamic parameters for wild type and mutant proteins. This represents an increase of 83% in unique mutations over previous databases and includes thermodynamic information on 204 new proteins. During manual curation we have also corrected annotation errors in previously curated entries. Associated with each entry, we have included information on the unfolding Gibbs free energy and melting temperature change, and have associated entries with available experimental structural information. ThermoMutDB supports users to contribute to new data points and programmatic access to the database via a RESTful API. ThermoMutDB is freely available at: http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/thermomutdb.",

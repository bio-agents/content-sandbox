      "sc:description": "An RPackage for Stepped Wedge Trial Design and Analysis.\n\nStepped wedge trials (SWTs) are a type of cluster-randomized trial that are commonly used to evaluate health care interventions. Most SWT-related software packages have restrictive assumptions about the study design and correlation structure of the data. The objective of this paper is to present a package and corresponding web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that provide researchers with another, more flexible option for SWT design and analysis. METHODS:We developed an Rpackage swCRTdesign ('stepped wedge Cluster Randomized Trial design'), which uses a random effects model to account for correlation in the data induced by a SWT design. Possible sources of correlation include clusters, time within clusters, and treatment within clusters",

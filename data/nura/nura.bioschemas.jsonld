      "sc:description": "A curated dataset of nuclear receptor modulators.\n\nNuclear receptors (NRs) are key regulators of human health and constitute a relevant target for medicinal chemistry applications as well as for toxicological risk assessment. Several open databases dedicated to small molecules that modulate NRs exist; however, depending on their final aim (i.e., adverse effect assessment or drug design), these databases contain a different amount and type of annotated molecules, along with a different distribution of experimental bioactivity values. Stemming from these considerations, in this work we aim to provide a unified dataset, NURA (NUclear Receptor Activity) dataset, collecting curated information on small molecules that modulate NRs, to be intended for both pharmacological and toxicological applications",

This package provides the generalized pipeline to perform integrative analysis of epi-genomic data (methylation, copy number alteration, mutation, microRNA, etc.) and gene-expression data from paired samples, and consists of 3 major modules:.\n\nIntegrative analysis of (Epi-)DNA and Gene Expression Data.",

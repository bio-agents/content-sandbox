                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2019 Knorr, Petzold and Marxen.In experimental psychology, subjects are often confronted with computer-based experimental paradigms. Creating such paradigms can require a lot of effort. PyParadigm is a newly developed Python library to ease the development of such paradigms by employing a declarative approach to build user interfaces (UIs). Paradigm specifications in this approach requires much less code and training than in alternative libraries. Although PyParadigm was initially developed for the creation of experimental paradigms, it is generally suited to build UIs that display or interact with 2D objects.",

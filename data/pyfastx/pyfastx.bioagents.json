For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.FASTA and FASTQ are the most widely used biological data formats that have become the de facto standard to exchange sequence data between bioinformatics agents. With the avalanche of next-generation sequencing data, the amount of sequence data being deposited and accessed in FASTA/Q formats is increasing dramatically. However, the existing agents have very low efficiency at random retrieval of subsequences due to the requirement of loading the entire index into memory. In addition, most existing agents have no capability to build index for large FASTA/Q files because of the limited memory. Furthermore, the agents do not provide support to randomly accessing sequences from FASTA/Q files compressed by gzip, which is extensively adopted by most public databases to compress data for saving storage. In this study, we developed pyfastx as a versatile Python package with commonly used command-line agents to overcome the above limitations. Compared to other agents, pyfastx yielded the highest performance in terms of building index and random access to sequences, particularly when dealing with large FASTA/Q files with hundreds of millions of sequences. A key advantage of pyfastx over other agents is that it offers an efficient way to randomly extract subsequences directly from gzip compressed FASTA/Q files without needing to uncompress beforehand. Pyfastx can easily be installed from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyfastx) and the source code is freely available at https://github.com/lmdu/pyfastx.",

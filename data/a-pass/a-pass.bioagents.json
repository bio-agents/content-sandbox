                "abstract": "Â© 2022 IOP Publishing LtdObjective. Concurrent electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) signals can be used to uncover the nature of brain activities during sleep. However, analyzing simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data is extremely time consuming and experience dependent. Thus, we developed a pipeline, which we named A-PASS, to automatically analyze simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data for studying brain activities during sleep. Approach. A deep learning model was trained on a sleep EEG-fMRI dataset from 45 subjects and used to perform sleep stage scoring. Various fMRI indices can be calculated with A-PASS to depict the neurophysiological characteristics across different sleep stages. We tested the performance of A-PASS on an independent sleep EEG-fMRI dataset from 28 subjects. Statistical maps regarding the main effect of sleep stages and differences between each pair of stages of fMRI indices were generated and compared using both A-PASS and manual processing methods. Main results. The deep learning model implemented in A-PASS achieved both an accuracy and F1-score higher than 70% for sleep stage classification on EEG data acquired during fMRI scanning. The statistical maps generated from A-PASS largely resembled those produced from manually scored stages plus a combination of multiple software programs. Significance. A-PASS allowed efficient EEG-fMRI data processing without manual operation and could serve as a reliable and powerful agent for simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies on sleep.",

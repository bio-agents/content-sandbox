                "abstract": "Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc..Argot2.5 (Annotation Retrieval of Gene Ontology Terms) is a web server designed to predict protein function. It is an updated version of the previous Argot2 enriched with new features in order to enhance its usability and its overall performance. The algorithmic strategy exploits the grouping of Gene Ontology terms by means of semantic similarity to infer protein function. The agent has been challenged over two independent benchmarks and compared to Argot2, PANNZER, and a baseline method relying on BLAST, proving to obtain a better performance thanks to the contribution of some key interventions in critical steps of the working pipeline. The most effective changes regard: (a) the selection of the input data from sequence similarity searches performed against a clustered version of UniProt databank and a remodeling of the weights given to Pfam hits, (b) the application of taxonomic constraints to filter out annotations that cannot be applied to proteins belonging to the species under investigation. The taxonomic rules are derived from our in-house developed agent, FunTaxIS, that extends those provided by the Gene Ontology consortium. The web server is free for academic users and is available online at http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/Argot2-5/.",

                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Identifying haplotypes is central to sequence analysis in diploid or polyploid genomes. Despite this, there remains a lack of research and agents designed for physical phasing and its downstream analysis. Results: HaplotypeAgents is a new agentset to phase variant sites using VCF and BAM files and to analyse phased VCFs. Phasing is achieved via the identification of reads overlapping ≥ 2 heterozygous positions and then extended by additional reads, a process that can be parallelized across a computer cluster. HaplotypeAgents includes various utility scripts for downstream analysis including crossover detection and phylogenetic placement of haplotypes to other lineages or species. HaplotypeAgents was assessed for accuracy against WhatsHap using simulated short and long reads, demonstrating higher accuracy, albeit with reduced haplotype length. HaplotypeAgents was also tested on real Illumina data to determine the ancestry of hybrid fungal isolate Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) SA-EC3, finding 80% of haplotypes across the genome phylogenetically cluster with parental lineages BdGPL (39%) and BdCAPE (41%), indicating those are the parental lineages. Finally, ~ 99% of phasing was conserved between overlapping phase groups between SA-EC3 and either parental lineage, indicating mitotic gene conversion/parasexuality as the mechanism of recombination for this hybrid isolate.

Conclusions: HaplotypeAgents is a powerful resource for analyzing hybrid or recombinant diploid or polyploid genomes and identifying parental ancestry for sub-genomic regions.",

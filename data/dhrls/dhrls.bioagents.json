                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Identifying potential associations between genes and diseases via biomedical experiments must be the time-consuming and expensive research works. The computational technologies based on machine learning models have been widely utilized to explore genetic information related to complex diseases. Importantly, the gene-disease association detection can be defined as the link prediction problem in bipartite network. However, many existing methods do not utilize multiple sources of biological information; Additionally, they do not extract higher-order relationships among genes and diseases. Results: In this study, we propose a novel method called Dual Hypergraph Regularized Least Squares (DHRLS) with Centered Kernel Alignment-based Multiple Kernel Learning (CKA-MKL), in order to detect all potential gene-disease associations. First, we construct multiple kernels based on various biological data sources in gene and disease spaces respectively. After that, we use CAK-MKL to obtain the optimal kernels in the two spaces respectively. To specific, hypergraph can be employed to establish higher-order relationships. Finally, our DHRLS model is solved by the Alternating Least squares algorithm (ALSA), for predicting gene-disease associations. Conclusion: Comparing with many outstanding prediction agents, DHRLS achieves best performance on gene-disease associations network under two types of cross validation. To verify robustness, our proposed approach has excellent prediction performance on six real-world networks. Our research work can effectively discover potential disease-associated genes and provide guidance for the follow-up verification methods of complex diseases.",

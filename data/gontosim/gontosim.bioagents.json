                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).The Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary that captures the semantics or context of an entity based on its functional role. Biomedical entities are frequently compared to each other to find similarities to help in data annotation and knowledge transfer. In this study, we propose GOntoSim, a novel method to determine the functional similarity between genes. GOntoSim quantifies the similarity between pairs of GO terms, by taking the graph structure and the information content of nodes into consideration. Our measure quantifies the similarity between the ancestors of the GO terms accurately. It also takes into account the common children of the GO terms. GOntoSim is evaluated using the entire Enzyme Dataset containing 10,890 proteins and 97,544 GO annotations. The enzymes are clustered and compared with the Gold Standard EC numbers. At level 1 of the EC Numbers for Molecular Function, GOntoSim achieves a purity score of 0.75 as compared to 0.47 and 0.51 GOGO and Wang. GOntoSim can handle the noisy IEA annotations. We achieve a purity score of 0.94 in contrast to 0.48 for both GOGO and Wang at level 1 of the EC Numbers with IEA annotations. GOntoSim can be freely accessed at (http://www.cbrlab.org/GOntoSim.html).",

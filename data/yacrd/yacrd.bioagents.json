For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Genome assembly is increasingly performed on long, uncorrected reads. Assembly quality may be degraded due to unfiltered chimeric reads; also, the storage of all read overlaps can take up to terabytes of disk space. Results: We introduce two agents: yacrd for chimera removal and read scrubbing, and fpa for filtering out spurious overlaps. We show that yacrd results in higher-quality assemblies and is one hundred times faster than the best available alternative.",

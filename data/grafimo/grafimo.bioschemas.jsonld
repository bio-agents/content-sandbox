      "sc:description": "GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences.\n\nGRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences) is a command-line agent that extends the traditional Position Weight Matrix (PWM) scanning procedure to VGs. GRAFIMO can search the occurrences of a given PWM in many genomes in a single run, accounting for the effects that SNPs, indels and potentially any structural variation (handled by VG) have on found potential motif occurrences. As result, GRAFIMO produces a report containing the statistically significant motif candidates found, reporting their frequency within the haplotypes embedded in the scanned VG and if they contain genomic variants or belong to the reference genome sequence.",

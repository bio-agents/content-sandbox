description: Analyzes finite mixture models for various parametric and semiparametric
  settings. This includes mixtures of parametric distributions (normal, multivariate
  normal, multinomial, gamma), various Reliability Mixture Models (RMMs), mixtures-of-regressions
  settings (linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, linear regression
  with changepoints, predictor-dependent mixing proportions, random effects regressions,
  hierarchical mixtures-of-experts), and agents for selecting the number of components
  (bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test statistic and model selection criteria).
  Bayesian estimation of mixtures-of-linear-regressions models is available as well
  as a novel data depth method for obtaining credible bands.

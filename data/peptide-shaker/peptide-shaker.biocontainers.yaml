description: Peptideshaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation
  of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines, currently supporting
  x!tandem, ms-gf+, ms amanda, omssa, myrimatch, comet, tide, mascot, andromeda and
  mzidentml. by combining the results from multiple search engines, while re-calculating
  ptm localization scores and redoing the protein inference, peptideshaker attempts
  to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics data!

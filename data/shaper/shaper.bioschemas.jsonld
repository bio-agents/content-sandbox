      "sc:description": "The SHAPER model provides user-friendly estimates of SHAPE reactivity from RNA 3D structures. The SHAPER model is an updated version of 3DSSR model, which takes RNA sequence-dependent bias into consideration. By analyzing structural features from an 3D RNA structure, such as 2D base-pairs, solvent accessibility of 2'-OH sites, stacking nucleotides, ribose sugar conformations, etc., the model can combine these key factors to predict the SHAPE reactivity for each nucleotide.",

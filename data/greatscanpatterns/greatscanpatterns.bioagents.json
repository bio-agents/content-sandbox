    "description": "Performs an automated and systematic analysis of periodic patterns in the position of a set of genomic features of interest along the genome. A complete analysis runs: detection of all possible periods from the positions of the genomic features, clustering of genomic features that are “in-phase” for every significant period found, and mapping of all the regions of the genome showing periodicities. Each step generates rich and interactive visualisations as well as machine-readable files.",

                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.GREAT (Genome REgulatory Architecture Agents) is a novel web portal for agents designed to generate user-friendly and biologically useful analysis of genome architecture and regulation. The online agents of GREAT are freely accessible and compatible with essentially any operating system which runs a modern browser. GREAT is based on the analysis of genome layout -defined as the respective positioning of co-functional genes- and its relation with chromosome architecture and gene expression. GREAT agents allow users to systematically detect regular patterns along co-functional genomic features in an automatic way consisting of three individual steps and respective interactive visualizations. In addition to the complete analysis of regularities, GREAT agents enable the use of periodicity and position information for improving the prediction of transcription factor binding sites using a multi-view machine learning approach. The outcome of this integrative approach features a multivariate analysis of the interplay between the location of a gene and its regulatory sequence. GREAT results are plotted in web interactive graphs and are available for download either as individual plots, self-contained interactive pages or as machine readable tables for downstream analysis. The GREAT portal can be reached at the following URL https://absynth.issb.genopole.fr/GREAT and each individual GREAT agent is available for downloading.",

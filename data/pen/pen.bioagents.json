                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The AuthorsResearchers have gained new therapeutic insights using multi-omics platform approaches to study DNA, RNA, and proteins of comprehensively characterized human cancer cell lines. To improve our understanding of the molecular features associated with oncogenic modulation in cancer, we proposed a proteogenomic database for human cancer cell lines, called Protein-gene Expression Nexus (PEN). We have expanded the characterization of cancer cell lines to include genetic, mRNA, and protein data of 145 cancer cell lines from various public studies. PEN contains proteomic and phosphoproteomic data on 4,129,728 peptides, 13,862 proteins, 7,138 phosphorylation site-associated genomic variations, 117 studies, and 12 cancer. We analyzed functional characterizations along with the integrated datasets, such as cis/trans association for copy number alteration (CNA), single amino acid variation for coding genes, post-translation modification site variation for Single Amino Acid Variation, and novel peptide expression for noncoding regions and fusion genes. PEN provides a user-friendly interface for searching, browsing, and downloading data and also supports the visualization of genome-wide association between CNA and expression, novel peptide landscape, mRNA-protein abundance, and functional annotation. Together, this dataset and PEN data portal provide a resource to accelerate cancer research using model cancer cell lines. PEN is freely accessible at http://combio.snu.ac.kr/pen.",

      "sc:description": "BetweenNet is a computational approach that integrates genomic data with a protein-protein interaction network to identify cancer driver genes. BetweenNet utilizes a measure based on betweenness centrality on patient specific networks to identify the so-called outlier genes that correspond to dysregulated genes for each patient. Setting up the relationship between the mutated genes and the outliers through a bipartite graph, it employs a random-walk process on the graph, which provides the final prioritization of the mutated genes.",

      "sc:description": "seeded NMF regression to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics spots with single-cell transcriptomes.\n\nThe goal of SPOTlight is to provide a agent that enables the deconvolution of cell types and cell type proportions present within each capture locations comprising mixtures of cells, originally developed for 10Xâ€™s Visium - spatial trancsiptomics- technology, it can be used for all technologies returning mixtures of cells. SPOTlight is based on finding topic profile signatures, by means of an NMFreg model, for each cell type and finding which combination fits best the spot we want to deconvolute.",

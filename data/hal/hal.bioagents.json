    "description": "A flexible platform for hybrid modeling with real-time visualization.\n\nHybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java library that facilitates hybrid modeling: spatial models with interacting agent-based and partial-differential equation components. HAL’s components can be broadly classified into: agent containers (on and off-lattice), finite difference diffusion fields, graphical user interface (GUI) components, and additional agents or utilities for computation and data manipulation. These components have a standardized interface that expedites the construction, analysis, and visualization of complex models.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java Library developed for use in mathematical oncology modeling. It is made of simple, efficient, generic components that can be used to model complex spatial systems. HAL's components can broadly be classified into: on- and off-lattice agent containers, finite difference diffusion fields, a GUI building system, and additional agents and utilities for computation and data collection. These components are designed to operate independently and are standardized to make them easy to interface with one another. As a demonstration of how modeling can be simplified using our approach, we have included a complete example of a hybrid model (a spatial model with interacting agent-based and PDE components). HAL is a useful asset for researchers who wish to build performant 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid models in Java, while not starting entirely from scratch. It is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL under the MIT License. HAL requires the Java JDK version 1.8 or later to compile and run the source code.",

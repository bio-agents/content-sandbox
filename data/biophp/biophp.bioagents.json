                "abstract": "Summary: Palindromic sequences, or inverted repeats (IRs), in DNA sequences involve important biological processes such as DNA-protein binding, DNA replication and DNA transposition. Development of bioinformatics agents that are capable of accurately detecting perfect IRs can enable genome-wide studies of IR patterns in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Different from conventional string-comparison approaches, we propose a novel algorithm that uses a cumulative score system based on a prime number representation of nucleotide bases. We then implemented this algorithm as a MATLAB-based program for perfect IR detection. In comparison with other existing agents, our program demonstrates a high accuracy in detecting nested and overlapping IRs. Â© 2013 The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

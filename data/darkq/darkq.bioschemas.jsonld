      "sc:description": "DarkQ is a messaging queue for microbial genomes. It tries to solve two problems: First, how to know about interesting genomes having been sequenced elsewhere, without having to download these genomes first. And second, how to retrieve the original genomes easily once we observe something interesting. Genomic surveillance is not only limited by the speed at which genomes can be shared, but by how fast they can reach the right person or algorithm to analyse them. If you are monitoring a regional outbreak of a multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and I send you some viral genomes, this will not be too useful.",

Methods are available to test for equilibrium and random mating at any even ploidy level (>2) in the presence of double reduction at biallelic loci. For autopolyploid populations in equilibrium, methods are available to estimate the degree of double reduction. We also provide functions to calculate genotype frequencies at equilibrium, or after one or several rounds of random mating, given rates of double reduction.",

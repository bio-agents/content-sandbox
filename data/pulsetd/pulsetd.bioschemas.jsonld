More importantly, it is able to predict the trend of mRNA transcription and expression changes in the future. In terms of performance, pulseTD has better robustness and accuracy than other methods.\n\nMaintainer: The package maintainer xindd_2014@163.com.\n\nTitle: Identification of Transcriptional Dynamics using Pulse Models via 4su-Seq Data and RNA-Seq Data.",

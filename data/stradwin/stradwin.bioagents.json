    "description": "Experimental, cross-platform agent primarily for freehand 3D ultrasound acquisition, visualisation and elastography. It can also be used with 3D medical data of any sort: its segmentation and surface extraction facilities are particularly powerful. It can load most types of DICOM image files and has unique facilities to measure bone cortical thickness from CT data.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2017 The Author(s).Imaging of bone metastasis response to therapy is a research priority. Stradwin is a new software-agent, with demonstrated sub-voxel accuracy in assessing cortical bone properties from routine CT. We applied this technology to the context of osseous metastases, with particular focus on disease progression using prostate cancer as a model. 3D-rendered 'bone-maps' were produced for 20 men with advanced prostate cancer, including a sub-cohort of 9 who had undergone serial scans. Correlation between baseline interpretation and assessments of progression between modalities was assessed. Bone-maps took significantly less time to interpret than CT bone windows (P<0.001). Initial bone-mapping, without adjustment, demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for suspicious areas on CT of 70.7% and 73.1% respectively. Evaluating disease over time, concordance between bone-maps and current practice using RECIST outcomes was 100%. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential use of this free post-processing software in the serial assessment of osseous metastases.",

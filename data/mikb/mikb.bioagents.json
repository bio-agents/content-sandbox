                "abstract": "Â© 2021Myocardial infarction knowledge base (MIKB; http://www.sysbio.org.cn/mikb/; latest update: December 31, 2020) is an open-access and manually curated database dedicated to integrating knowledge about MI to improve the efficiency of translational MI research. MIKB is an updated and expanded version of our previous MI Risk Knowledge Base (MIRKB), which integrated MI-related risk factors and risk models for providing help in risk assessment or diagnostic prediction of MI. The updated MIRKB includes 9701 records with 2054 single factors, 209 combined factors, 243 risk models, 37 MI subtypes and 3406 interactions between single factors and MIs collected from 4817 research articles. The expanded functional module, i.e. MIGD, is a database including not only MI associated genetic variants, but also the other multi-omics factors and the annotations for their functional alterations. The goal of MIGD is to provide a multi-omics level understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MI. MIGD includes 1782 omics factors, 28 MI subtypes and 2347 omics factor-MI interactions as well as 1253 genes and 6 chromosomal alterations collected from 2647 research articles. The functions of MI associated genes and their interaction with drugs were analyzed. MIKB will be continuously updated and optimized to provide precision and comprehensive knowledge for the study of heterogeneous and personalized MI.",

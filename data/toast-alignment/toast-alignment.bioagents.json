                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have reduced the cost of whole transcriptome analyses, allowing characterization of non-model species at unprecedented levels. The rapid pace of transcriptomic sequencing has driven the public accumulation of a wealth of data for phylogenomic analyses, however lack of agents aimed towards phylogeneticists to efficiently identify orthologous sequences currently hinders effective harnessing of this resource. Results: We introduce TOAST, an open source R software package that can utilize the ortholog searches based on the software Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) to assemble multiple sequence alignments of orthologous loci from transcriptomes for any group of organisms. By streamlining search, query, and alignment, TOAST automates the generation of locus and concatenated alignments, and also presents a series of outputs from which users can not only explore missing data patterns across their alignments, but also reassemble alignments based on user-defined acceptable missing data levels for a given research question. Conclusions: TOAST provides a comprehensive set of agents for assembly of sequence alignments of orthologs for comparative transcriptomic and phylogenomic studies. This software empowers easy assembly of public and novel sequences for any target database of candidate orthologs, and fills a critically needed niche for agents that enable quantification and testing of the impact of missing data. As open-source software, TOAST is fully customizable for integration into existing or novel custom informatic pipelines for phylogenomic inference. Software, a detailed manual, and example data files are available through github carolinafishes.github.io",

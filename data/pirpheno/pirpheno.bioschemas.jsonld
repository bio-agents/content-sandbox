The discovery of relationships between piRNAs and disease phenotypes has become increasingly important. piRPheno provides experimentally validated associations between piRNAs and disease phenotypes through manual curation on publications. piRPheno provides user-friendly web interfaces and RESTful application programming interfaces for users to browse, search, prioritize, analyze and access data freely.",

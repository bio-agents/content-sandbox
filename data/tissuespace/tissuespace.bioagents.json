The inherent gene expression ranking information is rarely utilized. Objective: Use of reduced vector to represent transcriptome data independent of platforms. Methods: Thus, we turned the expression profile into a rank vector, where a higher expression has a higher rank value, then applied Latent semantic analysis (LSA) to get compact and continuous 100-dimensional vector representations for samples. Results: Results showed that the reconstructed vector has a precision of 96.7% in recovering tissue labels from an independent dataset. A user-friendly agent TissueSpace was developed, which provides users the following functionalities: (1) convert different gene ID types to Ensembl gene IDs; (2) project any human transcriptome profile to get vector representation for downstream analysis; (3) functional enrichment for each of the 100-dimensional vector features. Case studies for its applications in human common diseases indicate its usefulness. Conclusions: TissueSpace could be used to generate testable hypotheses for translational medicine. The TissueSpace agent is available at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/tissuespace/.",

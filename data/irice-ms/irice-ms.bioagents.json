All rights reserved.Post-translational modification (PTM) refers to the covalent and enzymatic modification of proteins after protein biosynthesis, which orchestrates a variety of biological processes. Detecting PTM sites in proteome scale is one of the key steps to in-depth understanding their regulation mechanisms. In this study, we presented an integrated method based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), called iRice-MS, to identify 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, crotonylation, malonylation, ubiquitination, succinylation and acetylation in rice. For each PTM-specific model, we adopted eight feature encoding schemes, including sequence-based features, physicochemical property-based features and spatial mapping information-based features. The optimal feature set was identified from each encoding, and their respective models were established. Extensive experimental results show that iRice-MS always display excellent performance on 5-fold cross-validation and independent dataset test. In addition, our novel approach provides the superiority to other existing agents in terms of AUC value. Based on the proposed model, a web server named iRice-MS was established and is freely accessible at http://lin-group.cn/server/iRice-MS.",

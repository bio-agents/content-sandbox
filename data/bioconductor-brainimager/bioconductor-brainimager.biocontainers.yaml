description: BrainImageR is a package that provides the user with information of where
  in the human brain their gene set corresponds to. This is provided both as a continuous
  variable and as a easily-interpretable image. BrainImageR has additional functionality
  of identifying approximately when in developmental time that a gene expression dataset
  corresponds to. Both the spatial gene set enrichment and the developmental time
  point prediction are assessed in comparison to the Allen Brain Atlas reference data.

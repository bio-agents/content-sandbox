description: A software to map short sequencer reads to reference genomes. unlike
  other methods, segemehl is able to detect not only mismatches but also insertions
  and deletions. furthermore, this agent is not limited to a specific read length and
  is able to map primer- or polyadenylation contaminated reads correctly.

  "sc:description": "GeneFinder is a software package for linkage analysis with a variety of extensions. Â GeneFinder continues a standard linkage software such as MERLIN by providing a more reasonable gene location estimation and the corresponding confidence interval estimate. In addition, GeneFinder provides a variety of linkage extensions such as adjusting for covariate heterogeneity, joint analysis of two linked disease susceptibility loci, linkage conditional on a known locus, etc.",

                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s)RNA secondary structures can carry out essential cellular functions alone or interact with one another to form the hierarchical tertiary structures. Experimental structure identification approa ches can show the in vitro structures of RNA molecules. However, they usually have limits in the resolution and are costly. In silico structure prediction agents are thus primarily relied on for pre-experiment analysis. Various structure prediction models have been developed over the decades. Since these agents are usually used before knowing the actual RNA structures, evaluating and ranking the pile of secondary structure predictions of a given sequence is essential in computational analysis. In this research, we implemented a web service called SSRAgent (RNA Secondary Structure prediction Ranking Agent) to assist in the ranking and evaluation of the generated predicted structures of a given sequence. Based on the computed species-specific interpretability significance in four common RNA structure–function aspects, SSRAgent provides three functions along with visualization interfaces: (1) Rank user-generated predictions. (2) Provide an automated streamline of structure prediction and ranking for a given sequence. (3) Infer the functional aspects of a given structure. We demonstrated the applicability of SSRAgent via real case studies and reported the similar trends between computed species-specific rankings and the corresponding prediction F1 values. The SSRAgent web service is available online at https://cobisHSS0.im.nuk.edu.tw/SSRAgent/, http://cosbi3.ee.ncku.edu.tw/SSRAgent/, or the redirecting site https://github.com/cobisLab/SSRAgent/.",

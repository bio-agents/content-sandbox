All rights reserved.Motivation: G-quadruplexes (G4) are important regulatory non-B DNA structures with therapeutic potential. A agent for rational design of mutations leading to decreased propensity for G4 formation should be useful in studying G4 functions. Although agents exist for G4 prediction, no easily accessible agent for the rational design of G4 mutations has been available. Results: We developed a web-based agent termed G4Killer that is based on the G4Hunter algorithm. This new agent is a platform-independent and user-friendly application to design mutations crippling G4 propensity in a parsimonious way (i.e., keeping the primary sequence as close as possible to the original one). The agent is integrated into our DNA analyzer server and allows for generating mutated DNA sequences having the desired lowered G4Hunter score with minimal mutation steps.",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Modern sequencing technologies continue to revolutionize many areas of biology and medicine. Since the generated datasets are error-prone, downstream applications usually require quality control methods to pre-process FASTQ files. However, existing agents for this task are currently not able to fully exploit the capabilities of computing platforms leading to slow runtimes. Results: We present RabbitQC, an extremely fast integrated quality control agent for FASTQ files, which can take full advantage of modern hardware. It includes a variety of operations and supports different sequencing technologies (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore and PacBio). RabbitQC achieves speedups between one and two orders-of-magnitude compared to other state-of-the-art agents.",

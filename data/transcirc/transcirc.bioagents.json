Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.TransCirc (https://www.biosino.org/transcirc/) is a specialized database that provide comprehensive evidences supporting the translation potential of circular RNAs (circRNAs). This database was generated by integrating various direct and indirect evidences to predict coding potential of each human circRNA and the putative translation products. Seven types of evidences for circRNA translation were included: (i) ribosome/polysome binding evidences supporting the occupancy of ribosomes onto circRNAs; (ii) experimentally mapped translation initiation sites on circRNAs; (iii) internal ribosome entry site on circRNAs; (iv) published N-6-methyladenosine modification data in circRNA that promote translation initiation; (v) lengths of the circRNA specific open reading frames; (vi) sequence composition scores from a machine learning prediction of all potential open reading frames; (vii) mass spectrometry data that directly support the circRNA encoded peptides across back-splice junctions. TransCirc provides a user-friendly searching/browsing interface and independent lines of evidences to predicte how likely a circRNA can be translated. In addition, several flexible agents have been developed to aid retrieval and analysis of the data. TransCirc can serve as an important resource for investigating the translation capacity of circRNAs and the potential circRNA-encoded peptides, and can be expanded to include new evidences or additional species in the future.",

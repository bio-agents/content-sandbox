                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Read coverage of RNA sequencing data reflects gene expression and RNA processing events. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods, particularly \"full-length\" ones, provide read coverage of many individual cells and have the potential to reveal cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing. However, visualization agents suited to highlighting cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage are still lacking. Results: Here, we have developed Millefy, a agent for visualizing read coverage of scRNA-seq data in genomic contexts. Millefy is designed to show read coverage of all individual cells at once in genomic contexts and to highlight cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. By visualizing read coverage of all cells as a heat map and dynamically reordering cells based on diffusion maps, Millefy facilitates discovery of \"local\" region-specific, cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. We applied Millefy to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse embryonic stem cells and triple-negative breast cancers and showed variability of transcribed regions including antisense RNAs, 3 ′ UTR lengths, and enhancer RNA transcription. Conclusions: Millefy simplifies the examination of cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing events using scRNA-seq data. Millefy is available as an R package (https://github.com/yuifu/millefy) and as a Docker image for use with Jupyter Notebook (https://hub.docker.com/r/yuifu/datascience-notebook-millefy).",

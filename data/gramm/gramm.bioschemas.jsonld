      "sc:description": "Strategy for Intercorrelation Identification between Metabolome and Microbiome.\n\nAccumulating evidence points to the strong and complicated associations between the metabolome and the microbiome, which play diverse roles in physiology and pathology. Various correlation analysis approaches were applied to identify microbe-metabolite associations. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the existing methods and considering the characteristics of different types of omics data, we designed a special strategy, called Generalized coRrelation analysis for Metabolome and Microbiome (GRaMM), for the intercorrelation discovery between the metabolome and microbiome.",

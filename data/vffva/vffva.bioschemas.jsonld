      "sc:description": "VFFVA performs dynamic load blancing. In runtime, each worker gets a small chunk of reactions to process and once finished, gets another one and so on (right figure). This setting allows i) fast workers to process more reactions which allows all the workers to finish at the same time, and ii) does not require a priori balancing as the workers will automatically get chunk of reactions assigned from the queue.",

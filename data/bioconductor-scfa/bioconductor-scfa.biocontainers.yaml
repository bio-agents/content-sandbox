description: Subtyping via Consensus Factor Analysis (SCFA) can efficiently remove
  noisy signals from consistent molecular patterns in multi-omics data. SCFA first
  uses an autoencoder to select only important features and then repeatedly performs
  factor analysis to represent the data with different numbers of factors. Using these
  representations, it can reliably identify cancer subtypes and accurately predict
  risk scores of patients.

description: "Magic-BLAST is a agent for mapping large next-generation RNA or DNA \n\
  sequencing runs against a whole genome or transcriptome. Each alignment\noptimizes\
  \ a composite score, taking into account simultaneously the two\nreads of a pair,\
  \ and in case of RNA-seq, locating the candidate introns\nand adding up the score\
  \ of all exons. This is very different from other\nversions of BLAST, where each\
  \ exon is scored as a separate hit and\nread-pairing is ignored.\n\nMagic-BLAST\
  \ incorporates within the NCBI BLAST code framework ideas \ndeveloped in the NCBI\
  \ Magic pipeline, in particular hit extensions by local \nwalk and jump (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109056),\
  \ and \nrecursive clipping of mismatches near the edges of the reads, which avoids\n\
  accumulating artefactual mismatches near splice sites and is needed to\ndistinguish\
  \ short indels from substitutions near the edges.\n\nMore details about the algorithm\
  \ and comparison with other similar agents\nare presented here:\nhttps://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2996-x.\n"

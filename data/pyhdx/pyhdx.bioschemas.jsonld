      "sc:description": "Derivation and visualization of protection factors from Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry at near residue resolution.\n\nAbstract Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a powerful technique to monitor the intrinsic and conformational dynamics of proteins. Most HDX-MS experiments compare protein states (e.g. apoprotein vs liganded) and provide detailed information on differential dynamics between them obtained from multiple overlapping peptides. However, differential dynamics are difficult to compare across protein derivatives, oligomeric assemblies, homologues and samples treated under different buffer and protease conditions. A main reason is that peptide-based D-uptake differences do not inform on absolute intrinsic dynamics at the level of single aminoacyl residues",

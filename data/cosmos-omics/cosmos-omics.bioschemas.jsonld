COSMOS leverages extensive prior knowledge of signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and gene regulation with computational methods to estimate activities of transcription factors and kinases as well as network-level causal reasoning. This pipeline can provide mechanistic explanations for experimental observations across multiple omic data sets.",

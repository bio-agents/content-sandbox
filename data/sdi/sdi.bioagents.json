                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2020 Jia, Zhou and Cui.Different genes have their protein products localized in various subcellular compartments. The diversity in protein localization may serve as a gene characteristic, revealing gene essentiality from a subcellular perspective. To measure this diversity, we introduced a Subcellular Diversity Index (SDI) based on the Gene Ontology-Cellular Component Ontology (GO-CCO) and a semantic similarity measure of GO terms. Analyses revealed that SDI of human genes was well correlated with some known measures of gene essentiality, including protein–protein interaction (PPI) network topology measurements, dN/dS ratio, homologous gene number, expression level and tissue specificity. In addition, SDI had a good performance in predicting human essential genes (AUC = 0.702) and drug target genes (AUC = 0.704), and drug targets with higher SDI scores tended to cause more side-effects. The results suggest that SDI could be used to identify novel drug targets and to guide the filtering of drug targets with fewer potential side effects. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online database for querying SDI score for genes across eight species, and the predicted probabilities of human drug target based on SDI. The online database of SDI is available at: http://www.cuilab.cn/sdi.",

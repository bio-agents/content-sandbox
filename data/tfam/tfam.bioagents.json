                "abstract": "We have earlier published an automated statistical classifier of tRNA function called TFAM. Unlike tRNA gene-finders, TFAM uses information from the total sequences of tRNAs and not just their anticodons to predict their function. Therefore TFAM has an advantage in predicting initiator tRNAs, the amino acid charging identity of nonstandard tRNAs such as suppressors, and the former identity of pseudotRNAs. In addition, TFAM predictions are robust to sequencing errors and useful for the statistical analysis of tRNA sequence, function and evolution. Earlier versions of TFAM required a complicated installation and running procedure, and only bacterial tRNA identity models were provided. Here we describe a new version of TFAM with both a Web Server interface and simplified standalone installation. New TFAM models are available including a proteobacterial model for the bacterial lysylated isoleucine tRNAs, making it now possible for TFAM to correctly classify all tRNA genes for some bacterial taxa. First-draft eukaryotic and archaeal models are also provided making initiator tRNA prediction easily accessible genes to any researcher or genome sequencing effort. The TFAM Web Server is available at http://tfam.lcb.uu.se. © 2007 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "We present TFAM, an automated, statistical method to classify the identity of tRNAs. TFAM, currently optimized for bacteria, classifies initiator tRNAs and predicts the charging identity of both typical and atypical tRNAs such as suppressors with high confidence. We show statistical evidence for extensive variation in tRNA identity determinants among bacterial genomes due to variation in overall tDNA base content. With TFAM we have detected the first case of eukaryotic-like tRNA identity rules in bacteria. An α-proteobacterial clade encompassing Rhizobiales, Caulobacter crescentus Silicibacter pomeroyi, unlike a sister clade containing the Rickettsiales, Zymomonas mobilis and Gluconobacter oxydans, uses the eukaryotic identity element A73 instead of the highly conserved prokaryotic element C73. We confirm divergence of bacterial histidylation rules by demonstrating perfect covariation of α-proteobacterial tRNAHis acceptor stems and residues in the motif IIb tRNA-binding pocket of their histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS). Phylogenomic analysis supports lateral transfer of a eukaryotic-like HisRS into the α-proteobacteria followed by in situ adaptation of the bacterial tDNAHis and identity rule divergence. Our results demonstrate that TFAM is an effective agent for the bioinformatics, comparative genomics and evolutionary study of tRNA identity. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",

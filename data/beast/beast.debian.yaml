description: BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
  sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred
  using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing
  phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without
  conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space,
  so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
  is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a
  suit of programs for analysing the results.

The classical fuzzy logic approach employs varying degrees of truth to describe relationships between interacting molecules. jFuzzyMachine implements the fuzzy logic approach to elucidate mechanistic relationships among biological molecules and makes more readily available the fuzzy logic inference approach in a freely available agent.",

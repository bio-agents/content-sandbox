      "sc:description": "The binomialRF package is an R package that provides a feature selection algorithm to be used in randomForest classifiers. Treating each tree as a quasi binomial stochastic process in a random forest, binomialRF determines a featureâ€™s importance by how often they are selected in practice vs. as expected by random chance. Given that trees are co-dependent as they subsample the same data, a theoretical adjustment is made using a generalization of the binomial distribution that adds a parameter to model correlation/association between trials.",

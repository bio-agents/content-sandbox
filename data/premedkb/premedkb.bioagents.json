However, fragmentation and heterogeneity of available data makes it challenging to readily obtain first-hand information regarding some particular diseases, drugs, genes and variants of interest. Therefore, we developed the Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PreMedKB) by seamlessly integrating the four fundamental components of precision medicine: diseases, genes, variants and drugs. PreMedKB allows for search of comprehensive information within each of the four components, the relationships between any two or more components, and importantly, the interpretation of the clinical meanings of a patient's genetic variants. Pre- MedKB is an efficient and user-friendly agent to assist researchers, clinicians or patients in interpreting a patient's genetic profile in terms of discovering potential pathogenic variants, recommending therapeutic regimens, designing panels for genetic testing kits, and matching patients for clinical trials. PreMedKB is freely accessible and available at http: //www.fudan-pgx.org/premedkb/index.html#/home.",

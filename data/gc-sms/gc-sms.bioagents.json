                "abstract": "© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine and John Wiley & Sons LtdGastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous tumour with numerous differences of epidemiologic and clinicopathologic features between cardia cancer and non-cardia cancer. However, few studies were performed to construct site-specific GC prognostic models. In this study, we identified site-specific GC transcriptomic prognostic biomarkers using genetic algorithm (GA)-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) and GA-based Cox regression method (GA-Cox) in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The area under time-dependent receive operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) regarding 5-year survival and concordance index (C-index) was used to evaluate the predictive ability of Cox regression models. Finally, we identified 10 and 13 prognostic biomarkers for cardia cancer and non-cardia cancer, respectively. Compared to traditional models, the addition of these site-specific biomarkers could notably improve the model preference (cardia: AUCtraditional vs AUCcombined = 0.720 vs 0.899, P = 8.75E-08; non-cardia: AUCtraditional vs AUCcombined = 0.798 vs 0.994, P = 7.11E-16). The combined nomograms exhibited superior performance in cardia and non-cardia GC survival prediction (C-indexcardia = 0.816; C-indexnoncardia = 0.812). We also constructed a user-friendly GC site-specific molecular system (GC-SMS, https://njmu-zhanglab.shinyapps.io/gc_sms/), which is freely available for users. In conclusion, we developed site-specific GC prognostic models for predicting cardia cancer and non-cardia cancer survival, providing more support for the individualized therapy of GC patients.",

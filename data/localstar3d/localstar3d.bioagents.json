Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.A fast-growing number of non-coding RNA structures have been resolved and deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). In contrast to the wide range of global alignment and motif search agents, there is still a lack of local alignment agents. Among all the global alignment agents for RNA 3D structures, STAR3D has become a valuable agent for its unprecedented speed and accuracy. STAR3D compares the 3D structures of RNA molecules using consecutive base-pairs (stacks) as anchors and generates an optimal global alignment. In this article, we developed a local RNA 3D structural alignment agent, named LocalSTAR3D, which was extended from STAR3D and designed to report multiple local alignments between two RNAs. The benchmarking results show that LocalSTAR3D has better accuracy and coverage than other local alignment agents. Furthermore, the utility of this agent has been demonstrated by rediscovering kink-turn motif instances, conserved domains in group II intron RNAs, and the tRNA mimicry of IRES RNAs.",

To facilitate the studies of silencers and their potential roles in transcriptional control during normal development and disease, we developed this comprehensive database of silencers, SilencerDB.\n\nFor accurate classification of silencers, we propose a CNN-based model named DeepSilencer.\n\n$ pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.2 #pip install tensorflow==1.15.2.",

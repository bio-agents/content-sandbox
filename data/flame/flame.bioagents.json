    "description": "Flame is an open source framework for model development, hosting, and usage in production environments. Flame is a web application, with a Python backend and a web-based graphic interface, which can be used as a desktop application or installed in a server receiving requests from multiple users. Models can be built starting from any collection of biologically annotated chemical structures, since the software supports structural normalization, molecular descriptor generation and machine learning building, using predefined workflows. The model building workflow can be customized from the graphic interface, selecting the type of normalization, molecular descriptors, and machine learning algorithm to be used from a panel of state-of-the-art methods implemented natively.",

All rights reserved.We present GeneNet Agentbox for MATLAB (also available as a set of standalone applications for Linux). The agentbox, available as command-line or with a graphical user interface, enables biologists to assess connectivity among a set of genes of interest ('seed-genes') within a biological network of their choosing. Two methods are implemented for calculating the significance of connectivity among seed-genes: 'seed randomization' and 'network permutation'. Options include restricting analyses to a specified subnetwork of the primary biological network, and calculating connectivity from the seed-genes to a second set of interesting genes. Pre-analysis agents help the user choose the best connectivity-analysis algorithm for their network. The agentbox also enables visualization of the connections among seed-genes. GeneNet Agentbox functions execute in reasonable time for very large networks (∼10 million edges) on a desktop computer.",

description: This BioConductor package provides a pipeline for the analysis of GRO-
  seq data. Among the more advanced features, r-bioc-grohmm predicts the boundaries
  of transcriptional activity across the genome de novo using a two-state hidden Markov
  model (HMM). . The used model essentially divides the genome into transcribed and
  non- transcribed regions in a strand specific manner. HMMs are used to identify
  the leading edge of Pol II at genes activated by a stimulus in GRO-seq time course
  data. This approach allows the genome-wide interrogation of transcription rates
  in cells.

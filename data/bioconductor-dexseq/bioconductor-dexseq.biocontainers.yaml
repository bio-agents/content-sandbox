description: The package is focused on finding differential exon usage using rna-seq
  exon counts between samples with different experimental designs. it provides functions
  that allows the user to make the necessary statistical tests based on a model that
  uses the negative binomial distribution to estimate the variance between biological
  replicates and generalized linear models for testing. the package also provides
  functions for the visualization and exploration of the results.

This package reveals the identifiability of the inferred network parameters and optimizes experimental design for network perturbation studies. See our publication for details.\n\nYou can install the IdentiFlow package with pip:.\n\nThe package is easy to use and we demonstrate its most relevant features in the example below. You find the example script in identiflow/examples. This folder also contains the scripts that were used to analyse the KEGG pathways, as described in our paper.",

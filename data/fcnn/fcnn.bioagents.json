                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2019 Wang, Zhang, Yang, Yang, Tian and Ma.Measuring conditional relatedness, the degree of relation between a pair of genes in a certain condition, is a basic but difficult task in bioinformatics, as traditional co-expression analysis methods rely on co-expression similarities, well known with high false positive rate. Complement with prior-knowledge similarities is a feasible way to tackle the problem. However, classical combination machine learning algorithms fail in detection and application of the complex mapping relations between similarities and conditional relatedness, so a powerful predictive model will have enormous benefit for measuring this kind of complex mapping relations. To this need, we propose a novel deep learning model of convolutional neural network with a fully connected first layer, named fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), to measure conditional relatedness between genes using both co-expression and prior-knowledge similarities. The results on validation and test datasets show FCNN model yields an average 3.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy values for identifying gene–gene interactions collected from the COXPRESdb, KEGG, and TRRUST databases, and a benchmark dataset of Xiao-Yong et al. research, by grid-search 10-fold cross validation, respectively. In order to estimate the FCNN model, we conduct a further verification on the GeneFriends and DIP datasets, and the FCNN model obtains an average of 1.8% and 7.6% higher accuracy, respectively. Then the FCNN model is applied to construct cancer gene networks, and also calls more practical results than other compared models and methods. A website of the FCNN model and relevant datasets can be accessed from https://bmbl.bmi.osumc.edu/FCNN.",

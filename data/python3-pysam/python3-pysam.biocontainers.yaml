description: A python module for reading, manipulating and writing genomic data sets.
  pysam is a lightweight wrapper of the htslib C-API and provides facilities to read
  and write SAM/BAM/VCF/BCF/BED/GFF/GTF/FASTA/FASTQ files as well as access to the
  command line functionality of the samagents and bcfagents packages. The module supports
  compression and random access through indexing. This module provides a low-level
  wrapper around the htslib C-API as using cython and a high-level API for convenient
  access to the data within standard genomic file formats.

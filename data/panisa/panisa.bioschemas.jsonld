      "sc:description": "Deciphering the role of insertion sequences in the evolution of bacterial epidemic pathogens with panISa software.\n\npanISa is a software identifying insertion sequence (IS) on resequencing data (bam file) in bacterial genomes.\n\nThe panISa software searches for Insertion Sequences on NGS data ab initio (i.e. with a database-free approach) in bacterial genomes from short read data. Briefly, the software identifies a signature of insertion in the alignment by counting clipped reads on the start and end positions of the potential IS. These clipped reads overlap the direct repeats due to IS insertion. Finally, using a reconstruction of the beginning of both sides of the IS (IRL and IRR), panISa validates the IS by searching for inverted repeat regions.",

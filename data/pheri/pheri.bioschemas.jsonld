We strongly recommend NOT to install this software on your server, as it is not needed for Pheri program and files created by this pipeline are already included in Pheri installation. This repository is meant for people, which would like to go into the details of our work.\n\nThis is repository of Phage Host ExploRatIon agent. The main purpose of this program is to predict phage hosts from sequence in FASTA format. Currently we are able to predict 8 host genera with very high accuracy (around 97%). These genera are Arthrobacter, Escherichia, Gordonia, Lactococcus, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus.\n\nPHERI uses preprocessed data stored in the folder files. The whole preprocessing pipeline can be found here.\n\nTo install this agent please use our docker image.",

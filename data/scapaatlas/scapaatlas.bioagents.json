                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been widely recognized as a crucial step during the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that APA exerts key regulatory roles in many biological processes and often occurs in a tissue-and cell-type-specific manner. However, to our knowledge, there is no database incorporating information about APA at the cell-type level. Single-cell RNA-seq is a rapidly evolving and powerful agent that enable APA analysis at the cell-type level. Here, we present a comprehensive resource, scAPAatlas (http://www.bioailab.com:3838/scAPAatlas), for exploring APA across different cell types, and interpreting potential biological functions. Based on the curated scRNA-seq data from 24 human and 25 mouse normal tissues, we systematically identified cell-type-specific APA events for different cell types and examined the correlations between APA and gene expression level. We also estimated the crosstalk between cell-type-specific APA events and microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins. A user-friendly web interface has been constructed to support browsing, searching and visualizing multi-layer information of cell-type-specific APA events. Overall, scAPAatlas, incorporating a rich resource for exploration of APA at the cell-type level, will greatly help researchers chart cell type with APA and elucidate the biological functions of APA.",

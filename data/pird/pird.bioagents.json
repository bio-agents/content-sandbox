You can check the detailed information of each sample in the database, choose samples to analyze according to your need, and upload data to analyze. Your analysis results will be auto-saved, so you can return to check them at any time.",

All rights reserved.T and B cell receptors (TCRs and BCRs) play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing an enormous variety of external and internal antigens. Understanding these receptors is critical for exploring the process of immunoreaction and exploiting potential applications in immunotherapy and antibody drug design. Although a large number of samples have had their TCR and BCR repertoires sequenced using high-throughput sequencing in recent years, very few databases have been constructed to store these kinds of data. To resolve this issue, we developed a database. Results: We developed a database, the Pan Immune Repertoire Database (PIRD), located in China National GeneBank (CNGBdb), to collect and store annotated TCR and BCR sequencing data, including from Homo sapiens and other species. In addition to data storage, PIRD also provides functions of data visualization and interactive online analysis. Additionally, a manually curated database of TCRs and BCRs targeting known antigens (TBAdb) was also deposited in PIRD.",

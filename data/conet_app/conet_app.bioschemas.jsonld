It has been designed with (microbial) ecological data in mind, but can be applied in general to infer relationships between objects observed in different samples (for example between genes present or absent across organisms).\n\nCoNet - Co-occurrence Network inference.\n\nCoNet detects significant non-random patterns of co-occurrence (copresence and mutual exclusion) in incidence and abundance data.\n\n12th January 2018: Thanks to Lisa RÃ¶ttjers, there is now an R implementation of CoNet.",

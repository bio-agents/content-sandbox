Not only that, one base in RNA can pair with more than one bases simultaneously. This opens up a new dimension of research to detect such types of base-base pair networks in RNA and to analyze them. Even if a base do not form a pair, it may have significant extent of π-π stacking overlap that can stabilize the structures. In this work, we report a software agent, called BPNet, that accepts a mmCIF or PDB file and computes the base-pair/π-π contact network components using graph formalism. The software can run on Linux platform in both serial and parallel modes. It generates several information in suitable file formats for visualization of the networks. This paper describes the BPNet software and also presents some interesting results obtained by analyzing several RNA structures by the software to show its effectiveness.",

Even though there is a multitude of agents for preparation of Linked Data, they are still either quite limited, difficult to use or not compliant with recent W3C Recommendations. In this demonstration paper, we present LinkedPipes ETL, a lightweight, Linked Data preparation agent. It is focused mainly on smooth user experience including mobile devices, ease of integration based on full API coverage and universal usage thanks to its library of components. We build on our experience gained by development and use of UnifiedViews, our previous Linked Data ETL agent, and present four use cases in which our new agent excels in comparison.",

                "abstract": "© 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.There is a multitude of agents for preparation of Linked Data from data sources such as CSV and XML files. These agents usually perform as expected when processing examples, or smaller real world data. However, a majority of these agents become hard to use when faced with a larger dataset such as hundreds of megabytes large CSV file. Agents which load the entire resulting RDF dataset into memory usually have memory requirements unsatisfiable by commodity hardware. This is the case of RDF-based ETL agents. Their limits can be avoided by running them on powerful and expensive hardware, which is, however, not an option for majority of data publishers. Agents which process the data in a streamed way tend to have limited transformation options. This is the case of text-based transformations, such as XSLT, or per-item SPARQL transformations such as the streamed version of TARQL. In this paper, we show how the power and transformation options of RDF-based ETL agents can be combined with the possibility to transform large datasets on common consumer hardware for so called chunkable data - data which can be split in a certain way. We demonstrate our approach in our RDF-based ETL agent, LinkedPipes ETL. We include experiments on selected real world datasets and a comparison of performance and memory consumption of available agents.",

                "abstract": "© 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Companies and institutions now realize the potential of Linked Open Data (LOD) and they start publishing their own data as LOD. However, publishing LOD is still a challenging task. One of the main reasons is a lack of user friendly agenting which would properly support the whole LOD publishing process. The process typically consists of source data extraction, transformation to RDF, alignment with commonly used vocabularies, linking to other datasets, computing metadata, publishing on the web as a dump, loading into a triplestore and recording the dataset in a data catalog such as CKAN. In this paper we present LinkedPipes ETL, a agent for ETL-like LOD publishing, which mainly focuses on supporting such LOD publishing workflows in a user friendly way. In addition, the agent also eases consumption of already existing LOD data sources as it addresses some of the practical issues associated with it. Finally, the agent itself uses Linked Data technologies for representation of the ETL processes. We describe LinkedPipes ETL and its main distinguishing features in context of the use cases in which the agent has already been deployed. They include an institution of public administration, a municipality, a university, a software company and an open data initiative.",

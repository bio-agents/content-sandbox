                "abstract": "Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.DNA fiber fluorography is widely employed to study the kinetics of DNA replication, but the usefulness of this approach has been limited by the lack of freely-available automated analysis agents. Quantification of DNA fibers usually relies on manual examination of immunofluorescence microscopy images, which is laborious and prone to inter- and intra-operator variability. To address this, we developed an unbiased, fully automated algorithm that quantifies length and color of DNA fibers from fluorescence microscopy images. Our fiber quantification method, termed FiberQ, is an open-source image processing agent based on edge detection and a novel segment splicing approach. Here, we describe the algorithm in detail, validate our results experimentally, and benchmark the analysis against manual assessments. Our implementation is offered free of charge to the scientific community under the General Public License.",

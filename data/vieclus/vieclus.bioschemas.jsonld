A key component of our contribution are natural recombine operators that employ ensemble clusterings as well as multi-level techniques. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm successfully improves or reproduces all entries of the 10th DIMACS implementation challenge under consideration in a small amount of time. In fact, for most of the small instances, we can improve the old benchmark result in less than a minute. Moreover, while the previous best result for different instances has been computed by a variety of solvers, our algorithm can now be used as a single agent to compute the result.\n\nVieClus - Vienna Graph Clustering is a memetic algorithm",

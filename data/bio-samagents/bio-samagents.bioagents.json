All rights reserved.Motivation: bio-samagents is a Ruby language interface to SAMagents, the highly popular library that provides utilities for manipulating high-throughput sequence alignments in the Sequence Alignment/Map format. Advances in Ruby, now allow us to improve the analysis capabilities and increase bio-samagents utility, allowing users to accomplish a large amount of analysis using a very small amount of code. bio-samagents can also be easily developed to include additional SAMagents methods and hence stay current with the latest SAMagents releases. Results: We have added new Ruby classes for the MPileup and Variant Call Format (VCF) data formats emitted by SAMagents and introduced more analysis methods for variant analysis, including alternative allele calculation and allele frequency calling for SNPs. Our new implementation of bio-samagents also ensures that all the functionality of the SAMagents library is now supported and that bio-samagents can be easily extended to include future changes in SAMagents. bio-samagents 2 also provides methods that allow the user to directly produce visualization of alignment data.",

description: JELLYFISH is a agent for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in
  DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences of all such
  substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA sequence. JELLYFISH can count
  k-mers using an order of magnitude less memory and an order of magnitude faster
  than other k-mer counting packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table
  and by exploiting the "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase parallelism.

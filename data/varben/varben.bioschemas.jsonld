      "sc:description": "Generating in silico Reference Datasets for Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Bioinformatics Pipeline Evaluation.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly being adopted as a valuable method for the detection of somatic variants in clinical oncology. However, it is still challenging to reach a satisfactory level of robustness and standardization in clinical practice when using the currently available bioinformatics pipelines to detect variants from raw sequencing data. Moreover, appropriate reference datasets are lacking for clinical bioinformatics pipeline development, validation and proficiency testing. Here, we developed VarBen, an open-source software for variant simulation to generate customized reference datasets by directly editing the original sequencing reads",

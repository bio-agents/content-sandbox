                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.Cells operate and react to environmental signals thanks to a complex network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), the malfunction of which can severely disrupt cellular homeostasis. As a result, mapping and analyzing protein networks are key to advancing our understanding of biological processes and diseases. An invaluable part of these endeavors has been the house mouse (Mus musculus), the mammalian model organism par excellence, which has provided insights into human biology and disorders. The importance of investigating PPI networks in the context of mouse prompted us to develop the Mouse Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (MIPPIE). MIPPIE inherits a robust infrastructure from HIPPIE, its sister database of human PPIs, allowing for the assembly of reliable networks supported by different evidence sources and high-quality experimental techniques. MIPPIE networks can be further refined with tissue, directionality and effect information through a user-friendly web interface. Moreover, all MIPPIE data and meta-data can be accessed via a REST web service or downloaded as text files, thus facilitating the integration of mouse PPIs into follow-up bioinformatics pipelines.",

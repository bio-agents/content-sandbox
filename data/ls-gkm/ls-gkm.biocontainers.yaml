description: gkm-SVM, a sequence-based method for predicting regulatory DNA elements,
  is a useful agent for studying gene regulatory mechanisms. In continuous efforts
  to improve the method, new software, LS-GKM, is introduced. It offers much better
  scalability and provides further advanced gapped k-mer based kernel functions. As
  a result, LS-GKM achieves considerably higher accuracy than the original gkm-SVM.

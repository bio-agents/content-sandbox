  description: Software for integrating multi-omics experiments in BioConductor
  long_description: " MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of\n multiple\
    \ assays performed on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a\n familiar\
    \ Bioconductor user experience by extending concepts from\n SummarizedExperiment,\
    \ supporting an open-ended mix of standard data classes\n for individual assays,\
    \ and allowing subsetting by genomic ranges or rownames.\n"

  "sc:description": "The ElastoGUI application is a graphical user interface dedicated to analyze shear wave imaging data in images or clips recorded using specialized ultrasounds. The ElastoGUI application allow drawing forms of different shape (i.e., polygons, rectangles or circles) and size in a desired ultrasound frame, and then batch process the delimited color map region(s) in all frames that correspond to the shear wave imaging (SWE) rate in all imported files. From the delimited color map region(s) in frames, the ElastoGUI application processes young modulus (maximal value, mean and standard deviation), shear modulus (mean and standard deviation), shear wave velocity (mean and standard deviation) and form surface area. Drawing agents enable editing form shape and size across frames and files, but also enable keeping the exact same forms between files. Acquisition and Analyze software for elastography data recorded with AixplorerÂ® ultrasounds.",

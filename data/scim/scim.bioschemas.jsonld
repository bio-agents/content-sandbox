Data preprocessing was performed following the workflow described in (Chevrier et al., 2017, 2018). Cell-type assignment was performed using a Random Forest classifier trained on multiple manually gated samples. In the SCIM manuscript, we utilize a subset comprising B-Cells and T-Cells only, for a total of 135,334 cells.",

This package is centered on an approach using machine learning for path classification.\n\nRtrack is a package to process raw spatial tracking data (such as from the Morris water maze task) and calculate behavioural strategies.\n\nThe core Rtrack classifier provided by this package assigns one of 9 strategies to each path.\n\nA core functionality of the Rtrack package is the calculation of metrics from the path coordinates.",

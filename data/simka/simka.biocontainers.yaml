description: Simka and simkaMin are de novo comparative metagenomics agents. Simka
  represents each dataset as a k-mer spectrum and computes several classical ecological
  distances between them. SimkaMin outputs approximate (but very similar) results
  by subsampling the kmer space and requires much less computational resources.

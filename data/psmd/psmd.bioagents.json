PSMD was developed as a web-based comprehensive database comprising 678,106,741 perfect microsatellites and 43,848,943 compound microsatellites from 18,408 organisms covered almost all species with available genomic data. PSMD enables scientists to easily browse, filter, compare, download SSRs with relevant information",

                "abstract": "Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdMicrosatellites are widely distributed throughout nearly all genomes which have been extensively exploited as powerful genetic markers for diverse applications due to their high polymorphisms. Their length variations are involved in gene regulation and implicated in numerous genetic diseases even in cancers. Although much effort has been devoted in microsatellite database construction, the existing microsatellite databases still had some drawbacks, such as limited number of species, unfriendly export format, missing marker development, lack of compound microsatellites and absence of gene annotation, which seriously restricted researchers to perform downstream analysis. In order to overcome the above limitations, we developed PSMD (Pan-Species Microsatellite Database, http://big.cdu.edu.cn/psmd/) as a web-based database to facilitate researchers to easily identify microsatellites, exploit reliable molecular markers and compare microsatellite distribution pattern on genome-wide scale. In current release, PSMD comprises 678,106,741 perfect microsatellites and 43,848,943 compound microsatellites from 18,408 organisms, which covered almost all species with available genomic data. In addition to interactive browse interface, PSMD also offers a flexible filter function for users to quickly gain desired microsatellites from large data sets. PSMD allows users to export GFF3 formatted file and CSV formatted statistical file for downstream analysis. We also implemented an online agent for analysing occurrence of microsatellites with user-defined parameters. Furthermore, Primer3 was embedded to help users to design high-quality primers with customizable settings. To our knowledge, PSMD is the most extensive resource which is likely to be adopted by scientists engaged in biological, medical, environmental and agricultural research.",

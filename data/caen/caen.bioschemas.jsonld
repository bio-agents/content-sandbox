      "sc:description": "Category encoding (CAEN) method is proposed to select feature genes for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data classification. This novel method encodes categories by employing the rank of sequence samples for each gene in each class. Correlation coefficients are considered for gene and class with the rank of sample and a new rank of category. The highest gene correlation coefficients are considered feature genes, which are the most effective for classifying bulk and single-cell RNA-seq dataset.",

Meanwhile, users demand increasingly usable and integrated ways to access and analyse data, especially within convenient, integrated “workbench” environments. Resource descriptions are the core element of registry and workbench systems, which are used to both help the user find and comprehend available software agents, data resources, and Web Services, and to localise, execute and combine them. The descriptions are, however, hard and expensive to create and maintain, because they are volatile and require an exhaustive knowledge of the described resource, its applicability to biological research, and the data model and syntax used to describe it. We present here the Workbench Integration Enabler, a software component that will ease the integration of bioinformatics resources in a workbench environment, using their description provided by the existing IECHOR Agents and Data Services Registry.",

                "abstract": "© The Author 2017.Background: Bioinformaticians routinely use multiple software agents and data sources in their day-to-day work and have been guided in their choices by a number of cataloguing initiatives. The IECHOR Agents and Data Services Registry (bio.agents) aims to provide a central information point, independent of any specific scientific scope within bioinformatics or technological implementation. Meanwhile, efforts to integrate bioinformatics software in workbench and workflow environments have accelerated to enable the design, automation, and reproducibility of bioinformatics experiments. One such popular environment is the Galaxy framework, with currently more than 80 publicly available Galaxy servers around the world. In the context of a generic registry for bioinformatics software, such as bio.agents, Galaxy instances constitute a major source of valuable content. Yet there has been, to date, no convenient mechanism to register such services en masse. Findings: We present ReGaTE (Registration of Galaxy Agents in iEchor), a software utility that automates the process of registering the services available in a Galaxy instance. This utility uses the BioBlend application program interface to extract service metadata from a Galaxy server, enhance the metadata with the scientific information required by bio.agents, and push it to the registry. Conclusions: ReGaTE provides a fast and convenient way to publish Galaxy services in bio.agents. By doing so, service providers may increase the visibility of their services while enriching the software discovery function that bio.agents provides for its users.",

In support of these discoveries, a plethora of databases and agents are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand. Here we present a community-driven curation effort, supported by IECHOR-the European infrastructure for biological information-that aspires to a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources. The sustainable upkeep of this Agents and Data Services Registry is assured by a curation effort driven by and tailored to local needs, and shared amongst a network of engaged partners. As of November 2015, the registry includes 1785 resources, with depositions from 126 individual registrations including 52 institutional providers and 74 individuals. With community support, the registry can become a standard for dissemination of information about bioinformatics resources: we welcome everyone to join us in this common endeavour. The registry is freely available at https://bio.agents.",

Still, the integration of agents in such environments remains a cumbersome, time consuming and error-prone process. A major consequence is the incomplete or outdated description of agents that are often missing important information, including parameters and metadata such as publication or links to documentation. AgentDog (Agent DescriptiOn Generator) facilitates the integration of agents - which have been registered in the IECHOR agents registry (https://bio.agents) - into workbench environments by generating agent description templates. AgentDog includes two modules. The first module analyses the source code of the bioinformatics software with language-specific plugins, and generates a skeleton for a Galaxy XML or CWL agent description. The second module is dedicated to the enrichment of the generated agent description, using metadata provided by bio.agents. This last module can also be used on its own to complete or correct existing agent descriptions with missing metadata.",

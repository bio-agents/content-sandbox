                "abstract": "Â© 2021 American Chemical Society.Every laboratory performing mass-spectrometry-based proteomics strives to generate high-quality data. Among the many factors that impact the outcome of any experiment in proteomics is the LC-MS system performance, which should be monitored within each specific experiment and also long term. This process is termed quality control (QC). We present an easy-to-use agent that rapidly produces a visual, HTML-based report that includes the key parameters needed to monitor the LC-MS system performance, with a focus on monitoring the performance within an experiment. The agent, named RawBeans, generates a report for individual files or for a set of samples from a whole experiment. We anticipate that it will help proteomics users and experts evaluate raw data quality independent of data processing. The agent is available at https://bitbucket.org/incpm/prot-qc/downloads. The mass-spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD022816.",

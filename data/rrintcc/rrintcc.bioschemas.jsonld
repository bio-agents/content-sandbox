      "sc:description": "Region-based interaction detection in genome-wide case-control studies.\n\nIn genome-wide association study (GWAS), we aim at detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with diseases. Conventional SNP interaction detection methods like PLINK [1] and BOOST [2] are based on SNP-SNP interactions. Although single nucleotides are the building blocks of human genome, SNPs are not necessarily the smallest functional unit for complex phenotypes. Region-based strategies have been successful in studies aiming at marginal effects (the effect of a single SNP regardless of other SNPs). In this paper, we have developed RRIntCC [3], a novel region-region interaction detection method for case-control studies, by utilizing the correlations between individual SNP-SNP interactions based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) contrast test.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Large-scale and long-term metabolomic studies have attracted widespread attention in the biomedical studies yet remain challenging despite recent technique progresses. In particular, the ineffective way of experiment integration and limited capacity in metabolite annotation are known issues. Herein, we constructed an online agent MMEASE enabling the integration of multiple analytical experiments with an enhanced metabolite annotation and enrichment analysis (https://idrblab.org/mmease/). MMEASE was unique in capable of (1) integrating multiple analytical blocks; (2) providing enriched annotation for >330 thousands of metabolites; (3) conducting enrichment analysis using various categories/sub-categories. All in all, MMEASE aimed at supplying a comprehensive service for large-scale and long-term metabolomics, which might provide valuable guidance to current biomedical studies. Significance: To facilitate the studies of large-scale and long-term metabolomic analysis, MMEASE was developed to (1) achieve the online integration of multiple datasets from different analytical experiments, (2) provide the most diverse strategies for marker discovery, enabling performance assessment and (3) significantly amplify metabolite annotation and subsequent enrichment analysis. MMEASE aimed at supplying a comprehensive service for long-term and large-scale metabolomics, which might provide valuable guidance to current biomedical studies.",

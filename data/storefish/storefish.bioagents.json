    "description": "a database on the reproductive strategies of teleost fishes.\n\nTeleost fishes show the most outstanding reproductive diversity of all vertebrates. Yet to date, no one has been able to decisively explain this striking variability, nor to perform large-scale phylogenetic analyses of reproductive modes. Here, we describe STOREFISH 2.0, an online database easing the sharing of an original dataset on reproduction published in 2007, enriched with automated data extraction and presentation to display the knowledge acquired on temperate freshwater fish species. STOREFISH 2 contains the information for 80 freshwater fish species and 50 traits from the analysis of 1219 references. It is anticipated that this new database could be useful for freshwater biodiversity research, conservation, assessment, and management.",

  description: DNA sequence quality and vector trimming agent
  long_description: " Lucy is a utility that prepares raw DNA sequence fragments for\
    \ sequence\n assembly, possibly using the TIGR Assembler. The cleanup process\
    \ includes\n quality assessment, confidence reassurance, vector trimming and vector\n\
    \ removal. The primary advantage of Lucy over other similar utilities is\n that\
    \ it is a fully integrated, stand alone program.\n .\n Lucy was designed and written\
    \ at The Institute for Genomic Research\n (TIGR, now the J. Craig Venter Institute),\
    \ and it has been used here for\n several years to clean sequence data from automated\
    \ DNA sequencers prior\n to sequence assembly and other downstream uses. The quality\
    \ trimming\n portion of lucy makes use of phred quality scores, such as those\
    \ produced\n by many automated sequencers based on the Sanger sequencing method.\
    \ As\n such, lucy’s quality trimming may not be appropriate for sequence\n data\
    \ produced by some of the new “next-generation” sequencers.\n"

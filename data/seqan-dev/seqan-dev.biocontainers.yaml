description: An open source c++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures
  for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. our library applies
  a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility,
  and integration with other libraries. the library is easy to use and simplifies
  the development of new software agents with a minimal loss of performance. additionally,
  it includes several ready-made command line agents for common tasks in sequence analysis.

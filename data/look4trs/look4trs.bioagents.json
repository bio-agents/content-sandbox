All rights reserved.Motivation: Simple tandem repeats, microsatellites in particular, have regulatory functions, links to several diseases and applications in biotechnology. There is an immediate need for an accurate agent for detecting microsatellites in newly sequenced genomes. The current available agents are either sensitive or specific but not both; some agents require adjusting parameters manually. Results: We propose Look4TRs, the first application of self-supervised hidden Markov models to discovering microsatellites. Look4TRs adapts itself to the input genomes, balancing high sensitivity and low false positive rate. It auto-calibrates itself. We evaluated Look4TRs on 26 eukaryotic genomes. Based on F measure, which combines sensitivity and false positive rate, Look4TRs outperformed TRF and MISA - the most widely used agents - by 78 and 84%. Look4TRs outperformed the second and the third best agents, MsDetector and Tantan, by 17 and 34%. On eight bacterial genomes, Look4TRs outperformed the second and the third best agents by 27 and 137%.",

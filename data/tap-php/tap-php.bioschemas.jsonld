      "sc:description": "A static analysis model for PHP vulnerabilities based on token and deep learning technology.\n\nWith the widespread usage of Web applications, the security issues of source code are increasing. The exposed vulnerabilities seriously endanger the interests of service providers and customers. There are some models for solving this problem. However, most of them rely on complex graphs generated from source code or regex patterns based on expert experience. In this paper, TAP, which is based on token mechanism and deep learning technology, was proposed as an analysis model to discover the vulnerabilities of PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) Web programs conveniently and easily. Based on the token mechanism of PHP language, a custom tokenizer was designed, and it unifies tokens, supports some features of PHP and optimizes the parsing.",

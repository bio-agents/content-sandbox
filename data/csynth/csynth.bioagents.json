    "description": "CSynth is a physics based interactive visualisation platform for visualizing the 3D structure of the biological molecules. It is primarily designed to provide an engaging way to explore and understand the complex structure of the genome in 3D by integrating data from next generation sequencing (Hi-C) and modelling. For example, it allows the user to see a traditional Hi-C heat map overlaid with dynamically generated or precomputed 3D structures.",

Chromosome conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C, generate large amounts of data showing interaction points on the genome but these are hard to interpret using standard agents. Results: We have developed CSynth, an interactive 3D genome browser and real-time chromatin restraint-based modeller to visualize models of any chromosome conformation capture (3C) data. Unlike other modelling systems, CSynth allows dynamic interaction with the modelling parameters to allow experimentation and effects on the model. It also allows comparison of models generated from data in different tissues/cell states and the results of third-party 3D modelling outputs. In addition, we include an option to view and manipulate these complicated structures using Virtual Reality (VR) so scientists can immerse themselves in the models for further understanding. This VR component has also proven to be a valuable teaching and a public engagement agent. Availabilityand implementation: CSynth is web based and available to use at csynth.org.",

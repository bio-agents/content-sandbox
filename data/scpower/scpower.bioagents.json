    "description": "scPower is a R package for design and power analysis of cell type specific interindividual DE and eQTL studies using single cell RNA-seq. It enables the user to calculate the power for a given experimental setup and to choose for a restricted budget the optimal combination of experimental parameters which maximizes the power. Necessary experimental priors, e.g. effect sizes and expression distributions, can be taken from example data sets, saved in the package, or estimated from new data sets. The agent was evaluated with data from different tissues and single cell technologies, based on UMI counts and read counts.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Single cell RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptomics by providing cell type resolution for differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. However, efficient power analysis methods for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons are lacking. Here, we present scPower; a statistical framework for the design and power analysis of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic experiments. We modelled the relationship between sample size, the number of cells per individual, sequencing depth, and the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within cell types. We systematically evaluated these optimal parameter combinations for several single cell profiling platforms, and generated broad recommendations. In general, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model, including priors, is implemented as an R package and is accessible as a web agent. scPower is a highly customizable agent that experimentalists can use to quickly compare a multitude of experimental designs and optimize for a limited budget.",

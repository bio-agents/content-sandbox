All rights reserved.Motivation: Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) have demonstrated their significance in pharmaceuticals, diets and nutraceuticals, benefiting public health and global ecology. While significant efforts have been made to discover FBPs and to elucidate the underlying bioactivity mechanisms, there is lack of a systemic study of sequence-structure-activity relationship of FBPs in a large dataset. Results: Here, we construct a database of food-derived bioactive peptides (DFBP), containing a total of 6276 peptide entries in 31 types from different sources. Further, we develop a series of analysis agents for function discovery/repurposing, traceability, multifunctional bioactive exploration and physiochemical property assessment of peptides. Finally, we apply this database and data-mining techniques to discover new FBPs as potential drugs for cardiovascular diseases. The DFBP serves as a useful platform for not only the fundamental understanding of sequence-structure-activity of FBPs but also the design, discovery, and repurposing of peptide-based drugs, vaccines, materials and food ingredients.",

    "description": "PELE-MSM is a Monte Carlo Based Protocol for the Estimation of Absolute Binding Free Energies.\n\nIIt is a fully automatic platform based on our Monte Carlo algorithm, the Protein Energy Landscape Exploration method (PELE), for the estimation of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies, one of the most significant challenges in computer-aided drug design. \nBased on a ligand pathway approach, an initial short enhanced sampling simulation is performed to identify reasonable starting positions for more extended sampling. This stepwise approach allows for a significantly faster convergence of the free energy estimation using the Markov State Model (MSM) technique. \nPELE-MSM was applied on four diverse protein and ligand systems, successfully ranking compounds for two systems. Based on the results, current limitations and challenges with physics-based methods in computational structural biology are discussed.",

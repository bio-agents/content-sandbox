DBAASP is updated continuously, and at present, version 3.0 (DBAASP v3) contains >15 700 entries (8000 more than the previous version), including >14 500 monomers and nearly 400 homo- and heteromultimers. Of the monomeric antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), >12 000 are synthetic, about 2700 are ribosomally synthesized, and about 170 are nonribosomally synthesized. Approximately 3/4 of the entries were added after the initial release of the database in 2014 reflecting the recent sharp increase in interest in AMPs. Despite the increased interest, adoption of peptide antimicrobials in clinical practice is still limited as a consequence of several factors including side effects, problems with bioavailability and high production costs. To assist in developing and optimizing de novo peptides with desired biological activities, DBAASP offers several agents including a sophisticated multifactor analysis of relevant physicochemical properties. Furthermore, DBAASP has implemented a structure modelling pipeline that automates the setup, execution and upload of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of database peptides. At present, >3200 peptides have been populated with MD trajectories and related analyses that are both viewable within the web browser and available for download. More than 400 DBAASP entries also have links to experimentally determined structures in the Protein Data Bank. DBAASP v3 is freely accessible at http://dbaasp.org.",

      "sc:description": "A training and deployment platform based on Docker, OMOP-CDM, and FHIR Web Services.\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:To take full advantage of decision support, machine learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important that models are not only created, but also deployed in a clinical setting. The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a agent for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. METHODS:The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data",

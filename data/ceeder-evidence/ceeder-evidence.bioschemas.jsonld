The CEEDER project team collates all forms of evidence reviews and syntheses relevant to environmental management, as they are published or otherwise become available globally. The CEEDER database lists available (commercially published and ‘grey’) syntheses of primary research (e.g. critical reviews, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, rapid reviews) conducted to assess evidence on a specific question of environmental policy or management relevance.",

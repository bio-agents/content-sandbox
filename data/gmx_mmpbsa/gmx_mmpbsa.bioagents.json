                "abstract": "© 2021 American Chemical Society.Molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (Generalized-Born) surface area is one of the most popular methods to estimate binding free energies. This method has been proven to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large systems. As a result of its popularity, several programs have been developed for performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations within the GROMACS community. These programs, however, present several limitations. Here we present gmx_MMPBSA, a new agent to perform end-state free energy calculations from GROMACS molecular dynamics trajectories. gmx_MMPBSA provides the user with several options, including binding free energy calculations with different solvation models (PB, GB, or 3D-RISM), stability calculations, computational alanine scanning, entropy corrections, and binding free energy decomposition. Noteworthy, several promising methodologies to calculate relative binding free energies such as alanine scanning with variable dielectric constant and interaction entropy have also been implemented in gmx_MMPBSA. Two additional agents - gmx_MMPBSA_test and gmx_MMPBSA_ana - have been integrated within gmx_MMPBSA to improve its usability. Multiple illustrating examples can be accessed through gmx_MMPBSA_test, while gmx_MMPBSA_ana provides fast, easy, and efficient access to different graphics plotted from gmx_MMPBSA output files. The latest version (v1.4.3, 26/05/2021) is available free of charge (documentation, test files, and tutorials included) at https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA.",

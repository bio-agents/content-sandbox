LabxDB provides web-browser GUI and a programmatic API for intregration into pipelines.\n\nLabxDB for high-throughput sequencing (HTS) annotation. LabxDB seq organizes sample annotations using a structure of nested levels: from the top-level projects to the bottom level sequencing runs. LabxDB provides forms to easily create sample structure, to annotate and view (as captured by the image on the left) all levels at the same time. LabxDB seq comes with scripts to import HTS data from local sequencing facilities or public resources.",

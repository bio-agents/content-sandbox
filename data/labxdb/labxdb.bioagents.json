LabxDB seq organizes sample annotations using a structure of nested levels: from the top-level projects to the bottom level sequencing runs. LabxDB provides forms to easily create sample structure, to annotate and view (as captured by the image on the left) all levels at the same time. LabxDB seq comes with scripts to import HTS data from local sequencing facilities or public resources.",

All rights reserved.Summary: Experimental laboratory management and data-driven science require centralized software for sharing information, such as lab collections or genomic sequencing datasets. Although database servers such as PostgreSQL can store such information with multiple-user access, they lack user-friendly graphical and programmatic interfaces for easy data access and inputting. We developed LabxDB, a versatile open-source solution for organizing and sharing structured data. We provide several out-of-the-box databases for deployment in the cloud including simple mutant or plasmid collections and purchase-tracking databases. We also developed a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) database, LabxDB seq, dedicated to storage of hierarchical sample annotations. Scientists can import their own or publicly available HTS data into LabxDB seq to manage them from production to publication. Using LabxDB's programmatic access (REST API), annotations can be easily integrated into bioinformatics pipelines. LabxDB is modular, offering a flexible framework that scientists can leverage to build new database interfaces adapted to their needs.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Intermediately methylated regions occupy a significant fraction of the human genome and are closely associated with epigenetic regulations or cell-type deconvolution of bulk data. However, these regions show distinct methylation patterns, corresponding to different biological mechanisms. Although there have been some metrics developed for investigating these regions, the high noise sensitivity limits the utility for distinguishing distinct methylation patterns. Results: We proposed a method named MeConcord to measure local methylation concordance across reads and CpG sites, respectively. MeConcord showed the most stable performance in distinguishing distinct methylation patterns ('identical', 'uniform' and 'disordered') compared with other metrics. Applying MeConcord to the whole genome data across 25 cell lines or primary cells or tissues, we found that distinct methylation patterns were associated with different genomic characteristics, such as CTCF binding or imprinted genes. Further, we showed the differences of CpG island hypermethylation patterns between senescence and tumorigenesis by using MeConcord. MeConcord is a powerful method to study local read-level methylation patterns for both the whole genome and specific regions of interest.",

                "abstract": "© 2022.RNA secondary-structure (rSS) assignment is one of the most routine forms of analysis of RNA 3D structures. However, traditional rSS assignment programs require full-Atomic structures of the individual RNA nucleotides. This prevents their application to the modeling of RNA structures in which base atoms are missing. To address this issue, Coarse-grained Secondary Structure of RNA (CSSR), an algorithm for the assignment of rSS for structures in which nucleobase atomic positions are incomplete, has been developed. Using CSSR, an rSS assignment accuracy of ∼90% is achieved even for RNA structures in which only one backbone atom per nucleotide is known. Thus, CSSR will be useful for the analysis of experimentally determined and computationally predicted RNA 3D structures alike. The source code of CSSR is available at https://github.com/pylelab/CSSR.",

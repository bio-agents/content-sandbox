    "description": "Simul 6 is a software for electrophoresis simulating the movement of ions in liquid solutions in an electric field. It simulates the movement of ions in liquid solutions in an electric field. It solves numerically a set of nonlinear partial differential equations and nonlinear algebraic equations describing the continuity of ionic movement and acid-base equilibria.",

                "abstract": "© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Simul 6 is a 1D dynamic simulator of electromigration based on the mathematical model of electromigration in free solutions. The model consists of continuity equations for the movement of electrolytes in a separation channel, acid–base equilibria of weak electrolytes, and the electroneutrality condition. It accounts for any number of multivalent electrolytes or ampholytes and provides a complete picture about dynamics of electromigration and diffusion in the separation channel. The equations are solved numerically using software means which allow for parallelization and multithreaded computation. Simul 6 has a user-friendly graphical interface. It is typically used for inspection of system peaks (zones) in electrophoresis, stacking and preconcentrating analytes, optimization of separation conditions, method development in either capillary zone electrophoresis, isotachophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. Simul 6 is the successor of Simul 5, and has been launched as a free software available for download at https://simul6.app/.",

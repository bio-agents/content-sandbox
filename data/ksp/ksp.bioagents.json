                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Protein phosphorylation by kinases plays crucial roles in various biological processes including signal transduction and tumorigenesis, thus a better understanding of protein phosphorylation events in cells is fundamental for studying protein functions and designing drugs to treat diseases caused by the malfunction of phosphorylation. Although a large number of phosphorylation sites in proteins have been identified using high-throughput phosphoproteomic technologies, their specific catalyzing kinases remain largely unknown. Therefore, computational methods are urgently needed to predict the kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of these sites. Results: We developed KSP, a new algorithm for predicting catalyzing kinases for experimentally identified phosphorylation sites in human proteins. KSP constructs a network based on known protein-protein interactions and kinase-substrate relationships. Based on the network, it computes an affinity score between a phosphorylation site and kinases, and returns the top-ranked kinases of the score as candidate catalyzing kinases. When tested on known kinase-substrate pairs, KSP outperforms existing methods including NetworKIN, iGPS, and PKIS. Conclusions: We developed a novel accurate agent for predicting catalyzing kinases of known phosphorylation sites. It can work as a complementary network approach for sequence-based phosphorylation site predictors.",

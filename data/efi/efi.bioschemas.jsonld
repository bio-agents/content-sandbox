These agents originated in the Enzyme Function Initiative, a NIH-funded research project to develop a sequence / structure-based strategy for facilitating discovery of in vitro enzymatic and in vivo metabolic / physiological functions of unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects | The Enzyme Function Initiative agents are hosted at the Carl R | If you use the EFI web agents, please cite us: | A \"From The Bench\" article was recently published in Biochemistry and is available on the training resources page",

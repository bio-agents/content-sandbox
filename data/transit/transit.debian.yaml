description: This is a software that can be used to analyze Tn-Seq datasets. It includes
  various statistical calculations of essentiality of genes or genomic regions (including
  conditional essentiality between 2 conditions). These methods were developed and
  tested as a collaboration between the Sassetti lab (UMass) and the Ioerger lab (Texas
  A&M) . TRANSIT is capable of analyzing TnSeq libraries constructed with Himar1 or
  Tn5 datasets. . TRANSIT assumes you have already done pre-processing of raw sequencing
  files (.fastq) and extracted read counts into a .wig formatted file. The .wig file
  should contain the counts at all sites where an insertion could take place (including
  sites with no reads). For Himar1 datasets this is all TA sites in the genome. For
  Tn5 datasets this would be all nucleotides in the genome.

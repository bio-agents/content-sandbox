      "sc:description": "CORDITE is The Curated CORona Drug InTERactions Database for SARS-CoV-2. CORDITE aggregates all available knowledge on potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Since the outbreak in 2019, researchers are trying to find effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on de novo drug design and drug repurposing. The former approach is very time consuming and needs extensive testing in humans, whereas drug repurposing is more promising, as the drugs have already been tested for side effects, etc. At present, there is no treatment for COVID-19 that is clinically effective, but there is a huge amount of data from studies that analyze potential drugs. We developed CORDITE to efficiently combine state-of-the-art knowledge on potential drugs and make it accessible to scientists and clinicians",

However, due to incomplete genome coverage by these technologies, the identified SNPs are likely in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the causal polymorphisms, rather than be causal themselves. In addition, researchers could benefit from annotations for the identified candidate SNPs and, simultaneously, for all neighboring genes in genetic linkage. In such case, LD extent estimation surrounding the candidate SNPs is required to determine the regions encompassing genes of interest. We describe here an automated pipeline, “LD-annot,” designed to delineate specific regions of interest for a given experiment and candidate polymorphisms on the basis of LD extent, and furthermore, provide annotations for all genes within such regions. LD-annot uses standard file formats, bioinformatics agents, and languages to provide identifiers, coordinates, and annotations for genes in genetic linkage with each candidate polymorphism. Although the focus lies upon SNP arrays and GBS data as they are being routinely deployed, this pipeline can be applied to a variety of datasets as long as genotypic data are available for a high number of polymorphisms and formatted into a vcf file. A checkpoint procedure in the pipeline allows to test several threshold values for linkage without having to rerun the entire pipeline, thus saving the user computational time and resources. We applied this new pipeline to four different sample sets: two breeding populations GBS datasets, one within-pedigree SNP set coming from whole genome sequencing (WGS), and a very large multi-varieties SNP dataset obtained from WGS, representing variable sample sizes, and numbers of polymorphisms. LD-annot performed within minutes, even when very high numbers of polymorphisms are investigated and thus will efficiently assist research efforts aimed at identifying biologically meaningful genetic polymorphisms underlying phenotypic variation.

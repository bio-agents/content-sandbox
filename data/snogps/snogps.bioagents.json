                "abstract": "One of the largest families of small RNAs in eukaryotes is the H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), most of which guide RNA pseudouridine formation. So far, an effective computational method specifically for identifying H/ACA snoRNA gene sequences has not been established. We have developed snoGPS, a program for computationally screening genomic sequences for H/ACA guide snoRNAs. The program implements a deterministic screening algorithm combined with a probabilistic model to score gene candidates. We report here the results of testing snoGPS on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Six candidate snoRNAs were verified as novel RNA transcripts, and five of these were verified as guides for pseudouridine formation at specific sites in ribosomal RNA. We also predicted 14 new base-pairings between snoRNAs and known pseudouridine sites in S.cerevisiae rRNA, 12 of which were verified by gene disruption and loss of the cognate pseudouridine site. Our findings include the first prediction and verification of snoRNAs that guide pseudouridine modification at more than two sites. With this work, 41 of the 44 known pseudouridine modifications in S.cerevisiae rRNA have been linked with a verified snoRNA, providing the most complete accounting of the H/ACA snoRNAs that guide pseudouridylation in any species. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

                "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are two of the largest classes of non-protein-coding RNAs. Conventional gene finders that detect protein-coding genes do not find tRNA and snoRNA genes because they lack the codon structure and statistical signatures of protein-coding genes. Previously, we developed tRNAscan-SE, snoscan and snoGPS for the detection of tRNAs, methylation-guide snoRNAs and pseudouridylation-guide snoRNAs, respectively. tRNAscan-SE is routinely applied to completed genomes, resulting in the identification of thousands of tRNA genes. Snoscan has successfully detected methylation-guide snoRNAs in a variety of eukaryotes and archaea, and snoGPS has identified novel pseudouridylation-guide snoRNAs in yeast and mammals. Although these programs have been quite successful at RNA gene detection, their use has been limited by the need to install and configure the software packages on UNIX workstations. Here, we describe online implementations of these RNA detection agents that make these programs accessible to a wider range of research biologists. The tRNAscan-SE, snoscan and snoGPS servers are available at http:// lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/, http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoscan/ and http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoGPS/, respectively. © 2005 Oxford University Press.",

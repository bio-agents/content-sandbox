Therefore, the high-efficiency pipelines for pan-genome analysis are mostly needed. We have developed a new pan-genome analysis pipeline (PGAP), which can perform five analytic functions with only one command, including cluster analysis of functional genes, pan-genome profile analysis, genetic variation analysis of functional genes, species evolution analysis and function enrichment analysis of gene clusters. PGAP's performance has been evaluated on 11 Streptococcus pyogenes strains. Â© The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",

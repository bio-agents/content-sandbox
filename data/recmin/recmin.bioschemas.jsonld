  "sc:description": "Software to identify ancestral recombination events from population genetic data. Under certain assumptions the pattern of diversity at a collection of linked sites provides information allowing us to detect historic recombination events. This program calculates a lower bound on the number of recombination events required to construct any history of a sample, under the assumption that each segregating site has mutated only once since the most recent common ancestor of the sample.",

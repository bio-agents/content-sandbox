The recognition of polyadenylation signal (PAS) motif sequence is an important step in polyadenylation. In the past few years, some statistical machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for PAS identification. Although these methods predict PAS with success, there is room for their improvement on PAS identification. Results: In this study, we proposed a deep neural network-based computational method, called SANPolyA, for identifying PAS in human and mouse genomes. SANPolyA requires no manually crafted sequence features. We compared our method SANPolyA with several previous PAS identification methods on several PAS benchmark datasets. Our results showed that SANPolyA outperforms the state-of-Art methods. SANPolyA also showed good performance on leave-one-motif-out evaluation.",

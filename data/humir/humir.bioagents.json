Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.For many research aspects on small non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, computational agents and databases are developed. This includes quantification of miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs and tRNA fragments, circRNAs and others. Furthermore, the prediction of new miRNAs, isomiRs, arm switch events, target and target pathway prediction and miRNA pathway enrichment are common tasks. Additionally, databases and resources containing expression profiles, e.g., from different tissues, organs or cell types, are generated. This information in turn leads to improved miRNA repositories. While most of the respective agents are implemented in a species-independent manner, we focused on agents for human small non-coding RNAs. This includes four aspects: (1) miRNA analysis agents (2) databases on miRNAs and variations thereof (3) databases on expression profiles (4) miRNA helper agents facilitating frequent tasks such as naming conversion or reporter assay design. Although dependencies between the agents exist and several agents are jointly used in studies, the interoperability is limited. We present HumiR, a joint web presence for our agents. HumiR facilitates an entry in the world of miRNA research, supports the selection of the right agent for a research task and represents the very first step towards a fully integrated knowledge-base for human small non-coding RNA research. We demonstrate the utility of HumiR by performing a very comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer’s miRNAs.",

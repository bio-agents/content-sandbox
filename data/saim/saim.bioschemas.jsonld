The primary developer has been Marshall Colville (mjc449@cornell.edu) with assistance from Warren Zipfel and Matt Paszek | Given the scope of the project, the multiple revisions and adaptations that the hardware and software have gone through, and the fact that we are not electrical or software engineers the code tends to change styles and not follow typical conventions",

    "description": "epihet is an R-package that calculates the epigenetic heterogeneity between cancer cells and/or normal cells. The functions establish a pipeline that take in bisulfite sequencing data from multiple samples and use the data to track similarities and differences in epipolymorphism,proportion of discordantly methylated sequencing reads (PDR),and Shannon entropy values at epialleles that are shared between the samples.epihet can be used to perform analysis on the data by creating pheatmaps, box plots, PCA plots, and t-SNE plots. MA plots can also be created by calculating the differential heterogeneity of the samples. And we construct co-epihet network and perform network analysis.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2021, The Author(s).Intra-tumoral epigenetic heterogeneity is an indicator of tumor population fitness and is linked to the deregulation of transcription. However, there is no published computational agent to automate the measurement of intra-tumoral epigenetic allelic heterogeneity. We developed an R/Bioconductor package, epihet, to calculate the intra-tumoral epigenetic heterogeneity and to perform differential epigenetic heterogeneity analysis. Furthermore, epihet can implement a biological network analysis workflow for transforming cancer-specific differential epigenetic heterogeneity loci into cancer-related biological function and clinical biomarkers. Finally, we demonstrated epihet utility on acute myeloid leukemia. We found statistically significant differential epigenetic heterogeneity (DEH) loci compared to normal controls and constructed co-epigenetic heterogeneity network and modules. epihet is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/epihet.html.",

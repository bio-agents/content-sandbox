    "description": "Sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed in multiple batches or at different times. This can produce technical biases that can lead to incorrect results. This is a software agent that streamlines batch preprocessing and evaluation by providing interactive diagnostics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to explore the extent to which batch variation impacts the data. Its diagnostics help determine if batch adjustment is needed, and how correction should be applied.",

This often produces technical biases that can lead to incorrect results in the downstream analysis. There are several existing batch adjustment agents for '-omics' data, but they do not indicate a priori whether adjustment needs to be conducted or how correction should be applied. We present a software pipeline, BatchQC, which addresses these issues using interactive visualizations and statistics that evaluate the impact of batch effects in a genomic dataset. BatchQC can also apply existing adjustment agents and allow users to evaluate their benefits interactively. We used the BatchQC pipeline on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of this software agentkit.",

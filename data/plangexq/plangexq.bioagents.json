    "description": "PlanGexQ is a user-friendly interactive agent for the curation and annotation of planarian morphologies and gene expression patterns in a centralized database. PlanGexQ allows any user to define reference morphologies using mathematical graphs and a drag-and-drop interface. Gene expression pattern images can be uploaded to the program and then registered into the reference morphologies. Annotations with terms from the planarian anatomy ontology are autommatically created by analyzing the gene expression patterns and their textual descriptions. PlanGexQ represents a complete methodology for centralizing with formal and annotated descriptions the morphologies and gene expression patterns of planarian worms.",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Morphological and genetic spatial data from functional experiments based on genetic, surgical and pharmacological perturbations are being produced at an extraordinary pace in developmental and regenerative biology. However, our ability to extract knowledge from these large datasets are hindered due to the lack of formalization methods and agents able to unambiguously describe, centralize and interpret them. Formalizing spatial phenotypes and gene expression patterns is especially challenging in organisms with highly variable morphologies such as planarian worms, which due to their extraordinary regenerative capability can experimentally result in phenotypes with almost any combination of body regions or parts. Results: Here, we present a computational methodology and mathematical formalism to encode and curate the morphological outcomes and gene expression patterns in planaria. Worm morphologies are encoded with mathematical graphs based on anatomical ontology terms to automatically generate reference morphologies. Gene expression patterns are registered to these standard reference morphologies, which can then be annotated automatically with anatomical ontology terms by analyzing the spatial expression patterns and their textual descriptions. This methodology enables the curation and annotation of complex experimental morphologies together with their gene expression patterns in a centralized standardized dataset, paving the way for the extraction of knowledge and reverse-engineering of the much sought-after mechanistic models in planaria and other regenerative organisms.",

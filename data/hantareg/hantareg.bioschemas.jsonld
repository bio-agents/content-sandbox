Frequent outbreaks around the globe and endemic appearance in different parts of the world emphasize the substantial risk of hantavirus diseases. Increasing incidence rates, trends of changing distribution of hantavirus species and new insights into clinical courses of hantavirus diseases call for multinational surveillance. Furthermore, evidence-based guidelines for the management of hantavirus diseases and scoring systems, which allow stratification of patients into risk categories, are lacking.",

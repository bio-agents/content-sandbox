The abnormality of neddylation has previously been shown to be closely related to some human diseases. The detection of neddylation sites is essential for elucidating the regulation mechanisms of protein neddylation.\nAs the detection of the lysine neddylation sites by the traditional experimental method is often expensive and time-consuming, it is imperative to design computational methods to identify neddylation sites.",

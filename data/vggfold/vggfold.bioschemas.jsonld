      "sc:description": "Why can deep convolutional neural networks improve protein fold recognition? A visual explanation by interpretation.\n\nAs an essential task in protein structure and function prediction, protein fold recognition has attracted increasing attention. The majority of the existing machine learning-based protein fold recognition approaches strongly rely on handcrafted features, which depict the characteristics of different protein folds; however, effective feature extraction methods still represent the bottleneck for further performance improvement of protein fold recognition. As a powerful feature extractor, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can automatically extract discriminative features for fold recognition without human intervention, which has demonstrated an impressive performance on protein fold recognition",

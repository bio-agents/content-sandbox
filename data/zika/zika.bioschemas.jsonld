Our aim is to gather information about evidences and hypothesis that can lead researches about Zika virus. The database provides information about genes associated with the disease, their expression and interaction with sncRNA. Data will be inserted in ZIKV-CDB as they are released in public databases. If you want your data contextualized in our database, please contact us.",

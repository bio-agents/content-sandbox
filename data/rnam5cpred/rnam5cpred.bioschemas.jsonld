RNAm5CPred was developed by using support vector machine based on three different kinds of nucleotide composition features including KNF (K-nucleotide frequencies), KSNPF (K-spaced nucleotide pair frequencies) and pseDNC (pseudo dinucleotide composition). The input for the server is the RNA sequence. More details can be found in the tutorial",

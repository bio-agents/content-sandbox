The diagrams portray the hydrogen-bond interaction patterns and hydrophobic contacts between the ligand(s) and the main-chain or side-chain elements of the protein. The system is able to plot, in the same orientation, related sets of ligand-protein interactions. This facilitates popular research tasks, such as analyzing a series of small molecules binding to the same protein target, a single ligand binding to homologous proteins, or the completely general case where both protein and ligand change. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",

  description: Transcript assembly, differential expression and regulation for RNA-Seq
  long_description: " Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances,\
    \ and tests for\n differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It\
    \ accepts aligned\n RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious\
    \ set of\n transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these\n\
    \ transcripts based on how many reads support each one.\n"

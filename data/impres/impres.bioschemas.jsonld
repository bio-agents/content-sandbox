We developed the Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) agent and supplementary guide to address this challenge and provide researchers with a systematic approach to designing implementation research. METHODS:A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international, multidisciplinary expert panel engaged in an iterative brainstorming and consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes agent, representing core implementation science principles and concepts that researchers should consider when designing implementation research",

Published by Oxford University Press.Recent regenerative medicine studies have emphasized the need for increased standardization, harmonization and sharing of information related to stem cell product characterization, to help drive these innovative interventions toward public availability and to increase collaboration in the scientific community. Although numerous attempts and numerous databases have been made to manage these data, a platform that incorporates all the heterogeneous data collected from stem cell projects into a harmonized project-based framework is still lacking. The aim of the database, which is described in this study, is to provide an intelligent informatics solution that integrates comprehensive characterization of diverse stem cell product characteristics with research subject and project outcome information. In the resulting platform, heterogeneous data are validated using predefined ontologies and stored in a relational database, to ensure data quality and ease of access. Testing was performed using 51 published, publically available induced pluripotent stem cell projects conducted in clinical, preclinical and in-vitro evaluations. Future aims of this project include further increasing the database size to include all published stem cell trials and develop additional data visualization agents to improve usability. Our testing demonstrated the robustness of the proposed platform, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse common data elements, and the potential of this platform for driving knowledge generation from the aggregation and harmonization of these diverse data.",

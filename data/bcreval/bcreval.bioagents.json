                "abstract": "Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) also known as BS-seq has been widely used to measure the methylation of whole genome at single-base resolution. One of the key steps in the assay is converting unmethylated cytosines into thymines (BS conversion). Incomplete conversion of unmethylated cytosines can introduce false positive methylation call. Developing a quick method to evaluate bisulfite conversion ratio (BCR) is benefit for both quality control and data analysis of WGBS. Results: Here we provide a computational method named \"BCREval\" to estimate the unconverted rate (UCR) by using telomeric repetitive DNA as native spike-in control. We tested the method by using public WGBS data and found that it is very stable and most of BS conversion assays can achieve> 99.5% efficiency. The non-CpG DNA methylation at telomere fits a binomial model and may result from a random process with very low possibility (the ratio < 0.4%). And the comparison between BCREval and Bismark (Krueger and Andrews, Bioinformatics 27:1571-1572, 2011), a widely used BCR evaluator, suggests that our algorithm is much faster and more efficient than the latter. Conclusion: Our method is a simple but robust method to QC and speculates BCR for WGBS experiments to make sure it achieves acceptable level. It is faster and more efficient than current agents and can be easily integrated into presented WGBS pipelines.",

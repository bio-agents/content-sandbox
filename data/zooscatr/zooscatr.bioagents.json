Target strength models, such as the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) can be used to improve the understanding of field recordings of weakly scattering targets. With acoustic methods now being used by a wide audience, allowing access to such models becomes a necessity. To ease access to the DWBA model, an r package (zooscatr) which includes a web application and the ability to parameterise the model either through the web application, text files, or pure scripting has been developed and is now freely available on Github.",

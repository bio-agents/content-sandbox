      "sc:description": "MSU-Net is a agent for multi-scale U-net for 2D medical image segmentation. Aiming at the limitation of the convolution kernel with a fixed receptive field and unknown prior to optimal network width in U-Net, multi-scale U-Net (MSU-Net) is proposed by us for medical image segmentation. First, multiple convolution sequence is used to extract more semantic features from the images. Second, the convolution kernel with different receptive fields is used to make features more diverse. The problem of unknown network width is alleviated by efficient integration of convolution kernel with different receptive fields. In addition, the multi-scale block is extended to other variants of the original U-Net to verify its universality. Five different medical image segmentation datasets are used to evaluate MSU-Net. A variety of imaging modalities are included in these datasets, such as electron microscopy, dermoscope, ultrasound, etc",

      "sc:description": "PySpacell is a Python Package for Spatial Analysis of Cell Images.\n\nTechnologies such as microscopy, sequential hybridization, and mass spectrometry enable quantitative single-cell phenotypic and molecular measurements in situ. Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell-cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a agentbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect.",

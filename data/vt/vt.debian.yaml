  description: agentset for short variant discovery in genetic sequence data
  long_description: " vt is a variant agent set that discovers short variants from\
    \ Next Generation\n Sequencing data.\n .\n Vt-normalize is a agent to normalize\
    \ representation of genetic variants in\n the VCF.  Variant normalization is formally\
    \ defined as the consistent\n representation of genetic variants in an unambiguous\
    \ and concise way.  In\n vt a simple general algorithm to enforce this is implemented.\n"

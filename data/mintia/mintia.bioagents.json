                "abstract": "Â© 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.The earth harbors trillions of bacterial species adapted to very diverse ecosystems thanks to specific metabolic function acquisition. Most of the genes responsible for these functions belong to uncultured bacteria and are still to be discovered. Functional metagenomics based on activity screening is a classical way to retrieve these genes from microbiomes. This approach is based on the insertion of large metagenomic DNA fragments into a vector and transformation of a host to express heterologous genes. Metagenomic libraries are then screened for activities of interest, and the metagenomicDNAinserts of active clones are extracted to be sequenced and analysed to identify genes that are responsible for the detected activity. Hundreds of metagenomics sequences found using this strategy have already been published in public databases. Here we present the MINTIA software package enabling biologists to easily generate and analyze large metagenomic sequence sets, retrieved after activity-based screening. It filters reads, performs assembly, removes cloning vector, annotates open reading frames and generates user friendly reports as well as files ready for submission to international sequence repositories. The software package can be downloaded from.",

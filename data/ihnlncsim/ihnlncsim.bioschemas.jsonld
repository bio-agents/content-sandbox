      "sc:description": "Inferring lncRNA Functional Similarity Based on Integrating Heterogeneous Network Data.\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (long ncRNAs, lncRNA) are one of great importance non-coding RNA with exceeding 200 nucleotides which are involved in human crucial biological processes. Improved evidences has proved that lncRNAs with similar expression patterns, expression profile and associated with similar diseases may share similar functions. Using the available data to build networks that are able to systematically and comprehensively infer the functional similarity of lncRNA. Determining the functional similarity of lncRNAs is beneficial to clarify the mechanism of their in life activities and complex diseases.\n\nIHNLncSim is a freely and reliable computational model can calculate functional similarity between lncRNAs, it will be advantageous to discover their functions which are ambiguous.",

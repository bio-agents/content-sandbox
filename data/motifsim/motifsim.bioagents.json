The development for motif finders has flourished in the past years with many agents have been introduced to the research community. Although these agents possess exceptional features for detecting motifs, they report different results for an identical data set. Hence, using multiple agents is recommended because motifs reported by several agents are likely biologically significant. However, the results from multiple agents need to be compared for obtaining common significant motifs. MOTIFSIM web agent and command-line agent were developed for this purpose. In this work, we present several technical improvements as well as additional features to further support the motif analysis in our new release MOTIFSIM 2.1.",

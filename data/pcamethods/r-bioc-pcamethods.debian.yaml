  description: BioConductor collection of PCA methods
  long_description: " Provides Bayesian PCA, Probabilistic PCA, Nipals PCA,\n Inverse\
    \ Non-Linear PCA and the conventional SVD PCA. A cluster\n based method for missing\
    \ value estimation is included for\n comparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA may\
    \ be used to perform PCA\n on incomplete data as well as for accurate missing\
    \ value\n estimation. A set of methods for printing and plotting the\n results\
    \ is also provided. All PCA methods make use of the same\n data structure (pcaRes)\
    \ to provide a common interface to the\n PCA results. Initiated at the Max-Planck\
    \ Institute for\n Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany.\n"

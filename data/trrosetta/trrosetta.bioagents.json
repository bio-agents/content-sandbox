                "abstract": "© 2021 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe accuracy of de novo protein structure prediction has been improved considerably in recent years, mostly due to the introduction of deep learning techniques. In this work, trRosettaX, an improved version of trRosetta for protein structure prediction is presented. The major improvement over trRosetta consists of two folds. The first is the application of a new multi-scale network, i.e., Res2Net, for improved prediction of inter-residue geometries, including distance and orientations. The second is an attention-based module to exploit multiple homologous templates to increase the accuracy further. Compared with trRosetta, trRosettaX improves the contact precision by 6% and 8% on the free modeling targets of CASP13 and CASP14, respectively. A preliminary version of trRosettaX is ranked as one of the top server groups in CASP14's blind test. Additional benchmark test on 161 targets from CAMEO (between Jun and Sep 2020) shows that trRosettaX achieves an average TM-score ≈0.8, outperforming the top groups in CAMEO. These data suggest the effectiveness of using the multi-scale network and the benefit of incorporating homologous templates into the network. The trRosettaX algorithm is incorporated into the trRosetta server since Nov 2020. The web server, the training and inference codes are available at: https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/.",

                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.The trRosetta (transform-restrained Rosetta) server is a web-based platform for fast and accurate protein structure prediction, powered by deep learning and Rosetta. With the input of a protein’s amino acid sequence, a deep neural network is first used to predict the inter-residue geometries, including distance and orientations. The predicted geometries are then transformed as restraints to guide the structure prediction on the basis of direct energy minimization, which is implemented under the framework of Rosetta. The trRosetta server distinguishes itself from other similar structure prediction servers in terms of rapid and accurate de novo structure prediction. As an illustration, trRosetta was applied to two Pfam families with unknown structures, for which the predicted de novo models were estimated to have high accuracy. Nevertheless, to take advantage of homology modeling, homologous templates are used as additional inputs to the network automatically. In general, it takes ~1 h to predict the final structure for a typical protein with ~300 amino acids, using a maximum of 10 CPU cores in parallel in our cluster system. To enable large-scale structure modeling, a downloadable package of trRosetta with open-source codes is available as well. A detailed guidance for using the package is also available in this protocol. The server and the package are available at https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/ and https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/download/, respectively.",

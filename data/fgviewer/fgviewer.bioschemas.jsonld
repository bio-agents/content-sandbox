      "sc:description": "FGviewer is an online visualization agent for functional features of human fusion genes. FGviewer is aiming for the effective visualization of the functional features of fusion genes for better prioritization of therapeutic target selection. FGviewer provides functional feature annotations at four different levels: DNA-, RNA-, protein-, and pathogenic-levels. The same breakpoint line across four tiers will classify between FG involving or non-involving zone with multiple types of functional features. Those features include fusion mRNA and amino acid sequences based on the userâ€™s breakpoint coordinates, swapped gene expression regulatory (i.e., transcription factor or miRNA binding sites), protein functional features (i.e., protein domains, protein- protein interactions, binding sites of all molecules, secondary structure level feature, etc.), clinically relevant variants, etc.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: It is a challenging problem in systems biology to infer both the network structure and dynamics of a gene regulatory network from steady-state gene expression data. Some methods based on Boolean or differential equation models have been proposed but they were not efficient in inference of large-scale networks. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to infer the network structure and dynamics accurately on large-scale networks using steady-state expression. Results: In this study, we propose a novel constrained genetic algorithm-based Boolean network inference (CGA-BNI) method where a Boolean canalyzing update rule scheme was employed to capture coarse-grained dynamics. Given steady-state gene expression data as an input, CGA-BNI identifies a set of path consistency-based constraints by comparing the gene expression level between the wild-type and the mutant experiments. It then searches Boolean networks which satisfy the constraints and induce attractors most similar to steady-state expressions. We devised a heuristic mutation operation for faster convergence and implemented a parallel evaluation routine for execution time reduction. Through extensive simulations on the artificial and the real gene expression datasets, CGA-BNI showed better performance than four other existing methods in terms of both structural and dynamics prediction accuracies. Taken together, CGA-BNI is a promising agent to predict both the structure and the dynamics of a gene regulatory network when a highest accuracy is needed at the cost of sacrificing the execution time.",

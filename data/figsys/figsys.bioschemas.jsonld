  "sc:description": "Used for processing, analyzing and presenting data and creating science documents of all kinds. It is powerful but easily accessible to users of all levels of experience. Turning your data into basic figure types such as line graphs, bar charts, areagrams, drop-plots or scatter diagrams is completely automatic and there are endless refinements which can be added with the simple-to-use agents. Text-only charts can be created and 3D data graphing is also included.",

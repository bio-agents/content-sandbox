      "sc:description": "Phage protein receptors have multiple interaction partners and high expressions.\n\nA knowledge resource to understand virus diversity.\n\nphageReceptor is a database of phage-host receptor interactions, which included 427 pairs of phage-host receptor interactions, 341 unique viral species/sub-species, and 69 bacterial species. Based on phageReceptor, we systematically analyzed the associations between phage-host receptor interactions, and characterized the phage protein receptors by structure, function, protein-protein interaction and expression. If you use this database, please cite the following manuscript: Phage protein receptors have multiple interaction partners and high expressions (see more details).\n\nPMID: doi: 10.11843/j.issn.0366-6964.2018.11.018 D01083026.",

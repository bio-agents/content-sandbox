      "sc:description": "Proteome-wide prediction of spontaneous protein deamidation highlights differences between taxa.\n\nNGOME-Lite is a fast algorithm able to predict non-enzymatic deamidation of internal asparagine residues in proteins in the absence of structural data, using sequence-based predictions of secondary structure and intrinsic disorder. NGOME-Lite does not require three-dimensional structures yet yields better predictions than available sequence-only methods. Just protein sequences in FASTA or multi-FASTA format is needed to run NGOME-Lite.\n\nPrediction of spontaneous asparagine deamidation at a proteomic scale.",

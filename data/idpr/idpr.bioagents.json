This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are proteins or protein-domains that do not have a single native structure, rather, they are a class of flexible peptides that can rapidly adopt multiple conformations. IDPs are quite abundant, and their dynamic characteristics provide unique advantages for various biological processes. The field of \"unstructured biology\"has emerged, in part, because of numerous computational studies that had identified the unique characteristics of IDPs and IDRs. The package 'idpr', short for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in R, implements several R functions that match the established characteristics of IDPs to protein sequences of interest. This includes calculations of residue composition, charge-hydropathy relationships, and predictions of intrinsic disorder. Additionally, idpr integrates several amino acid substitution matrices and calculators to supplement IDP-based workflows. Overall, idpr aims to integrate agents for the computational analysis of IDPs within R, facilitating the analysis of these important, yet under-characterized, proteins. The idpr package can be downloaded from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/idpr/).",

      "sc:description": "An independently validated survival nomogram for lower grade glioma.\n\nBACKGROUND:Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Diffuse low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas, which together comprise the lower-grade gliomas [LGG] (WHO grades II and III), present a therapeutic challenge to physicians due to the heterogeneity of their clinical behavior. Nomograms are useful agents for individualized estimation of survival. This study aimed to develop and independently validate a survival nomogram for patients with newly diagnosed LGG. METHODS:Data were obtained for newly diagnosed LGG patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Ohio Brain Tumor Study (OBTS) with the following variables: tumor grade (II or III), age at diagnosis, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and molecular subtype (IDH mutant with 1p 19q codeletion [IDHmut-codel], IDH mutant without 1p 19q codeletion [IDHmut-non-codel], IDH wild-type [IDHwt])",

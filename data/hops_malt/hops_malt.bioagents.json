    "description": "Automated detection and authentication of pathogen DNA in archaeological remains.\n\nHOPS is a java pipeline which focuses on screening MALT data (see Table of Contents) for the presence of a user-specified list of target species. The pipeline essentially exists to make it easier to use MALT and MaltExtract in unison. To use HOPS you will need a config file, which specifies some key parameters for MALT and MaltExtract. You can have multiple config files to quickly redo a previous analysis or archive them to remember parameters you used in an analysis. HOPS will in every case create a log that tells you which command was sent to Slurm, in case you encounter problems, that log file is a very good place to start looking for the problem",

Such analyses are not restricted to present-day samples and can also be applied to molecular data from archaeological remains. Investigations of ancient microbes can provide valuable information on past bacterial commensals and pathogens, but their molecular detection remains a challenge. Here, we present HOPS (Heuristic Operations for Pathogen Screening), an automated bacterial screening pipeline for ancient DNA sequences that provides detailed information on species identification and authenticity. HOPS is a versatile agent for high-throughput screening of DNA from archaeological material to identify candidates for genome-level analyses.",

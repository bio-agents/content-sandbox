It spans the comprehensive range of capabilities including access to databases with experimental data, agents for formalized description of biological systems structure and functioning, as well as agents for their visualization, simulation, parameters fitting and analyses. Due to scripts (R, JavaScript) and workflow support it provides powerful possibilities for analyses of high-throughput data.",

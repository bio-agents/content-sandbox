                "abstract": "Â© The Author 2017.Background: Research projects often involve observation, registration, and data processing starting from information obtained in field experiments. In many cases, these tasks are carried out by several persons in different places, times, and ways, adding different levels of complexity and error in data collecting. Furthermore, data processing can be time consuming, and input errors may produce unwanted results. Results: We have developed a novel, open source software called Phenobook, an easy, flexible, and intuitive agent to organize, collect, and save experimental data for further analyses. Phenobook was conceived to collect phenotypic observations in a user-friendly, cost-effective way. It consists of a web-based software for experiment design, data input and visualization, and exportation, combined with a mobile application for remote data collecting. We provide in this article a detailed description of the developed agent. Conclusion: Phenobook is a software agent that can be easily implemented in collaborative research and development projects involving data collecting and forward analyses. Adopting Phenobook is expected to improve the involved processes by minimizing input errors, resulting in higher quality and reliability of the research outcomes.",

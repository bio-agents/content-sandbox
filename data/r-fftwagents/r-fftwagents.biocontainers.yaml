description: 'Provides a wrapper for several FFTW functions. This package provides
  access to the two-dimensional FFT, the multivariate FFT, and the one-dimensional
  real to complex FFT using FFTW3. The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw
  which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions fft and mvfft.
  The FFT functions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant
  complex conjugate when the input is real data. '

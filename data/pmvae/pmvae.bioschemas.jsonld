      "sc:description": "Learning Interpretable Single-Cell Representations with Pathway Modules.\n\npmVAE leverages biological prior information in the form of pathway gene sets to construct interpretable representations of single-cell data. It uses pathway module sub networks to construct a latent space factorized by pathway gene sets. Each pathway has a corresponding module which behaves as a mini VAE acting only on the participating genes. These modules produce latent representations that can be direcrly interpreted within the context of a specific pathway. To account for overlapping pathway gene sets (due to e.g. signaling hierarchies) we have a custom training procedure to encourage module independence.",

This use case implemented SNOMED CT for browsing COVID-19 questionnaires in the open-software solutions OPAL/MICA. We implemented a test server requiring files in a given YAML format for implementation of taxonomies with only two levels of hierarchy. Within this format, neither the implementation of SNOMED CT hierarchies and post-coordination nor the use of release files were possible. To solve this, Python scripts were written to integrate the required SNOMED CT concepts (Fully Specified Name, FSN and SNOMED CT Identifier, SCTID) into the YAML format (YAML Mode). Mappings of SNOMED CT to data items of the questionnaires had to be provided as Excel files for implementation into Opal/MICA and further Python scripts were established within the Excel Mode. Finally, a total of eight questionnaires containing 1.178 data items were successfully mapped to SNOMED CT and implemented in OPAL/MICA. This use case showed that implementing SNOMED CT for browsing COVID-19 questionnaires is feasible despite software solutions not supporting SNOMED CT. However, limitations of not being able to implement SNOMED CT release files and its provided hierarchy and post-coordination still have to be overcome.",

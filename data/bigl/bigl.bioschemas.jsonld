Combination therapies are increasingly adopted as the standard of care for various diseases to improve treatment response, minimise the development of resistance and or minimise adverse events. Therefore, synergistic combinations are screened early in the drug discovery process, in which their potential is evaluated by comparing the observed combination effect to that expected under a null model.",

description: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. Thus, making
  HTML reports is easy. Includes a function that allows redirection on the fly, which
  appears to be very useful for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of
  the produced output to keep all that he did during the course. Package comes with
  a vignette describing how to write HTML reports for statistical analysis. Finally,
  a driver for 'Sweave' allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to automatically
  write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).

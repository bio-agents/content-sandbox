      "sc:description": "CNAdbCC is a curated database for copy number aberrations analysis and visualization of cervical cancer. Currently, the database contains about 1,000 dataset samples mainly integrated by affymetrix and aligent platform. Affymetrix is based on light-controlled situ synthesis of DNA microarrays, and is the highest density and widely used chip preparation technology. In addition, agilent aCGH (array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization) platform also provides high performance, high resolution chip data. The raw array data were collected from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer GenomeAtlas) databases. Genomic DNA copy number variations (CNVs), a type of structure variations, is one of the key hallmarks of carcinogenesis.",

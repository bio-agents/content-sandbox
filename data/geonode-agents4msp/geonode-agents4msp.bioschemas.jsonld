Agents4MSP implements models for Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA), Maritime Use Conflict (MUC) Analysis and Marine Ecosystem Services Threat (MES-Threat) analysis. The package can be used as stand-alone library or as integrated GeoNode Plugin providing additional functionalities to geospatial CMS and enhancing usability through a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nGallery Quick Start Try the Demo Blog.\n\nThe webagents (GeoNode integration) analysis workflow follows a four step approach:",

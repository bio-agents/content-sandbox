This app was created to allow for offline data collection in studies where stringent data-security requirements must be met (see https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244028), though it can also be run online if needed. The application allows for field navigation and secure field-level data capture. It also serves as a bridge to an alternate software, like EpiInfo, to collect participant-level questionnaire data.

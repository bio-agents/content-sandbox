description: 'This package compiles most information measures currently available:
  mutual information, conditional mutual information, interaction information, partial
  information decomposition and part mutual information. Using gene expression profile
  data, all these estimators can be employed to quantify nonlinear dependence between
  variables in biological regulatory network inference. The first estimator is used
  to infer bivariate network while the last four estimators are dedicated to analyze
  trivariate networks.'

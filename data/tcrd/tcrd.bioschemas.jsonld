TCRD contains information about human targets, with special emphasis on four families of targets that are central to the NIH IDG initiative: GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors. Olfactory GPCRs (oGPCRs) are treated as a separate family. A key aim of the KMC is to classify the development/druggability level of targets. We currently categorize targets into four development/druggability levels (TDLs) defined as follows:.",

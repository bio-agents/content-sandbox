The workflow consists of several steps involving the bioinformatic processing of biological data. We have developed a suite of web-based online bioinformatic agents to assist with processing, analysis and curation of DNA sequence data. Most of these agents are genome-agnostic, with two agents specifically designed for hepatitis B virus sequence data. Agents in the suite are able to process sequence data from Sanger sequencing, ultra-deep amplicon resequencing (pyrosequencing) and chromatograph (trace files), as appropriate. The agents are available online at no cost and are aimed at researchers without specialist technical computer knowledge. The agents can be accessed at http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/SmallGenomeAgents, and the source code is available online at https://github.com/DrTrevorBell/SmallGenomeAgents.",

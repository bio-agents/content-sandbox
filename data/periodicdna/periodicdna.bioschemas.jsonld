The functions of this package provide a straightforward approach to find periodic occurrences of k-mers in DNA sequences, such as regulatory elements. It is not aimed at identifying motifs separated by a conserved distance; for this type of analysis, please visit MEME website.\n\nAlignment, Coverage, DataImport, MotifAnnotation, MotifDiscovery, SequenceMatching, Sequencing, Software.\n\nThis R package helps the user identify k-mers (e.g. di- or tri-nucleotides) present periodically in a set of genomic loci (typically regulatory elements).",

Research Synthesis Methods published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Despite a major increase in the range and number of software offerings now available to help researchers produce evidence syntheses, there is currently no generic agent for producing figures to display and explore the risk-of-bias assessments that routinely take place as part of systematic review. However, agents such as the R programming environment and Shiny (an R package for building interactive web apps) have made it straightforward to produce new agents to help in producing evidence syntheses. We present a new agent, robvis (Risk-Of-Bias VISualization), available as an R package and web app, which facilitates rapid production of publication-quality risk-of-bias assessment figures. We present a timeline of the agent's development and its key functionality.",

description: An interface for the single-cell rnaseq-oriented loom format. loom files
  are an hdf5-based format for storing and interacting with large single-cell rnaseq
  datasets. loomr provides an interface for working with loom files in a loom-specific
  way; we provide routines for validating loom files, iterating with chunks through
  data within the loom file, and provide a platform for other packages to build support
  for loom files.

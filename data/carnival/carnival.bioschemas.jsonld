      "sc:description": "contextualizing large signaling networks with CARNIVAL.\n\nCAusal Reasoning for Network Identification with integer VALue programming in R.\n\nCARNIVAL is an R-package providing a framework to perform causal reasoning to infer a subset of signalling network from transcriptomics data. This work was originally based on Melas et al. with a number improved functionalities comparing to the original version. Transcription factors’ (TFs) activities and pathway scores from gene expressions can be inferred with our in-house agents DoRothEA & PROGENy, respectively. TFs’ activities and signed directed protein-protein interaction networks +/- drug targets and pathway scores are then used to derive a series of linear constraints to generate integer linear programming (ILP) problems. An ILP solver (CPLEX) is subsequently applied to identify the sub-network topology with minimised discrepancies on fitting error and model size",

                "abstract": "© 2017, The Author(s).Introduction: The field of metabolomics has expanded greatly over the past two decades, both as an experimental science with applications in many areas, as well as in regards to data standards and bioinformatics software agents. The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software agents. Objectives: To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and agents that are used primarily in metabolomics. Methods: The most widely used agents were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the agent being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Agents were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. LC–MS, GC–MS or NMR) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. Results: A comprehensive list of the most used agents was compiled. Each agent is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable agents of the same domain. An extended list including additional agents is available at https://github.com/RASpicer/MetabolomicsAgents which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. Conclusion: This review presents the most widely used agents for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality. As future work, we suggest a direct comparison of agents’ abilities to perform specific data analysis tasks e.g. peak picking.",

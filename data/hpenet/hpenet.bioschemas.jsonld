      "sc:description": "Co-expression Network Database for <i>de novo</i> Transcriptome Assembly of <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> Pall.\n\nPaeonia lactiflora Pall., commonly known as the herbaceous peony, is an ornamental flowering plant known around the world. Its oil contains a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). We produced 40 in-house RNA-seq datasets from 10 different tissues and performed de novo transcriptome assembly to obtain a complete transcriptome. Moreover,we had constructed the co-expression network database, HpeNet, which contains transcriptome data, gene information, the co-expression network, and so forth. Furthermore some analytical agents, such as blast, gene expression profiling analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), were supported for network analysis and functional annotation. We hope that the HpeNet database will be beneficial to future work on Paeonia lactiflora Pall.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.Computational techniques for predicting interactions of proteins and druglike molecules have often been used to search for compounds that bind a given protein with high affinity. More recently, such agents have also been applied to the reverse procedure of searching protein targets for a given compound. Among methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions, ligand-based methods relying on similarity to ligands of known interactions are effective only when similar protein-ligand interactions are known. Receptor-based methods predicting protein-ligand interactions by molecular docking are effective only when high-accuracy receptor structures and binding sites are available. Moreover, the computational cost of molecular docking tends to be too high to be applied to the entire protein structure database. In this paper, an effective target prediction method, which combines ligand similarity-based and receptor structure-based approaches, is introduced. In this method, protein-ligand docking is performed after efficient structure- A nd similarity-based screening. The enriched protein target database by predicted binding ligands and sites allows detection of protein targets with previously unknown ligand interactions. The method, called GalaxySagittarius, is freely available as a web server at http://galaxy.seoklab.org/sagittarius.",

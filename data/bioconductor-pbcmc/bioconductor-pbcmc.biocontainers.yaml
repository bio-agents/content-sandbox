description: The pbcmc package characterizes uncertainty assessment on gene expression
  classifiers, a. k. a. molecular signatures, based on a permutation test. In order
  to achieve this goal, synthetic simulated subjects are obtained by permutations
  of gene labels. Then, each synthetic subject is tested against the corresponding
  subtype classifier to build the null distribution. Thus, classification confidence
  measurement can be provided for each subject, to assist physician therapy choice.
  At present, it is only available for PAM50 implementation in genefu package but
  it can easily be extend to other molecular signatures.

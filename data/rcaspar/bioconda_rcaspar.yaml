description: 'The package is the R-version of the C-based software \bold{CASPAR} (Kaderali,2006:
  \url{http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/12/1495}). It is meant
  to help predict survival times in the presence of high-dimensional explanatory covariates.
  The model is a piecewise baseline hazard Cox regression model with an Lq-norm based
  prior that selects for the most important regression coefficients, and in turn the
  most relevant covariates for survival analysis. It was primarily tried on gene expression
  and aCGH data, but can be used on any other type of high-dimensional data and in
  disciplines other than biology and medicine.'

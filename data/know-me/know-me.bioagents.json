This paper presents the development and evaluation of a design agentkit to facilitate the work of designers and healthcare professionals in personalising dementia care. This agentkit, named “Know-me”, was grounded in the findings of Ergonomics in Aging, Co-design, and Data-enabled Design, derived from literature review and from the field during a four-year doctorate project. “Know-me” was designed to be easily accessible, flexible, and engaging, providing concrete and hands-on guidance for designers and healthcare professionals to use in designing for personalised dementia care. A proof-of-concept evaluation of the “Know-me” agentkit was conducted via student projects on design for dementia care. During this process, we found that “Know-me” could be adapted flexibly so that the care team could use some of the agents by themselves. A feature-by-feature comparison of the “Know-me” agentkit with similar state-of-the-art agentkits was conducted, and based upon this, the strengths and weaknesses of the “Know-me” agentkit are discussed. This preliminary study indicates that the “Know-me” agentkit is a helpful addition to the current pool of agentkits on designing for dementia care.",

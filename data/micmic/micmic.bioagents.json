                "abstract": "Â© 2018 The Author(s).Aberrant promoter methylation is a common mechanism for tumor suppressor inactivation in cancer. We develop a set of agents to identify genome-wide DNA methylation in distal regions with causal effect on tumorigenesis called MICMIC. Many predictions are directly validated by dCas9-based epigenetic editing to support the accuracy and efficiency of our agent. Oncogenic and lineage-specific transcription factors are shown to aberrantly shape the methylation landscape by modifying tumor-subtype core regulatory circuitry. Notably, the gene regulatory networks orchestrated by enhancer methylation across different cancer types are seen to converge on a common architecture. MICMIC is available on https://github.com/ZhangJlab/MICMIC.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Recent advances in single-cell open-chromatin and transcriptome profiling have created a challenge of exploring novel applications with a meaningful transformation of read-counts, which often have high variability in noise and drop-out among cells. Here, we introduce UniPath, for representing single-cells using pathway and gene-set enrichment scores by a transformation of their open-chromatin or gene-expression profiles. The robust statistical approach of UniPath provides high accuracy, consistency and scalability in estimating gene-set enrichment scores for every cell. Its framework provides an easy solution for handling variability in drop-out rate, which can sometimes create artefact due to systematic patterns. UniPath provides an alternative approach of dimension reduction of single-cell open-chromatin profiles. UniPath's approach of predicting temporal-order of single-cells using their pathway enrichment scores enables suppression of covariates to achieve correct order of cells. Analysis of mouse cell atlas using our approach yielded surprising, albeit biologically-meaningful co-clustering of cell-types from distant organs. By enabling an unconventional method of exploiting pathway co-occurrence to compare two groups of cells, our approach also proves to be useful in inferring context-specific regulations in cancer cells.

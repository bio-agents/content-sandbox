description: MiXCR is a universal framework that processes big immunome data from
  raw sequences to quantitated clonotypes. MiXCR efficiently handles paired- and single-end
  reads, considers sequence quality, corrects PCR errors and identifies germline hypermutations.
  The software supports both partial- and full-length profiling and employs all available
  RNA or DNA information, including sequences upstream of V and downstream of J gene
  segments.

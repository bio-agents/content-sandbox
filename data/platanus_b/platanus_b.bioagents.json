    "description": "PLATform for Assembling NUcleotide Sequences.\nThis is an accurate de novo assembler for bacterial genomes using an iterative error-removal process.\n\nPlatanus_B is a de novo assembler for isolated bacterial genomes. The features of this agent are as follows: (1) It requires at least one Illuimina paired-end library. This library is useful for large-scale and/or high-resolution analysis. (2) It also can accept Oxford-Nanopore and/or PacBio long reads (\"iterate\" command). (3) Implementing the iteration of sequence-extensions, gap-closing and error-removals, it can archive assemblies with contiguity and accuracy for many cases. (4) As an utility function, it can combine multiple assemblies through the \"combine\" command.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Kazusa DNA Research Institute.De novo assembly of short DNA reads remains an essential technology, especially for large-scale projects and high-resolution variant analyses in epidemiology. However, the existing agents often lack sufficient accuracy required to compare closely related strains. To facilitate such studies on bacterial genomes, we developed Platanus-B, a de novo assembler that employs iterations of multiple error-removal algorithms. The benchmarks demonstrated the superior accuracy and high contiguity of Platanus-B, in addition to its ability to enhance the hybrid assembly of both short and nanopore long reads. Although the hybrid strategies for short and long reads were effective in achieving near full-length genomes, we found that short-read-only assemblies generated with Platanus-B were sufficient to obtain ≥90% of exact coding sequences in most cases. In addition, while nanopore long-read-only assemblies lacked fine-scale accuracies, inclusion of short reads was effective in improving the accuracies. Platanus-B can, therefore, be used for comprehensive genomic surveillances of bacterial pathogens and high-resolution phylogenomic analyses of a wide range of bacteria.",

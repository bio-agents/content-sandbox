                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Elsevier LtdThere are hundreds of RNA binding proteins in the human genome alone and their interactions with messenger and other RNAs in a cell regulate every step in an RNA's life cycle. To understand this interplay of proteins and RNA it is important to be able to know which protein binds which RNA how strongly and where. Here, we introduce RBPBind, a web-based agent for the quantitative prediction of the interaction of single-stranded RNA binding proteins with target RNAs that fully takes into account the effect of RNA secondary structure on binding affinity. Given a user-specified RNA and a protein selected from a set of several RNA-binding proteins, RBPBind computes their binding curve and effective binding constant. The server also computes the probability that, at a given protein concentration, a protein molecule will bind to any particular nucleotide along the RNA. The sequence specificity of the protein-RNA interaction is parameterized from public RNAcompete experiments and integrated into the recursions of the Vienna RNA package to simultaneously take into account protein binding and RNA secondary structure. We validate our approach by comparison to experimentally determined binding affinities of the HuR protein for several RNAs of different sequence contexts from the literature, showing that integration of raw sequence affinities into RNA secondary structure prediction significantly improves the agreement between computationally predicted and experimentally measured binding affinities. Our resource thus provides a quick and easy way to obtain reliable predicted binding affinities and locations for single-stranded RNA binding proteins based on RNA sequence alone.",

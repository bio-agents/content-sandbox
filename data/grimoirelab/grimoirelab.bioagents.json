                "abstract": "© 2021 Dueñas et al.Background: After many years of research on software repositories, the knowledge for building mature, reusable agents that perform data retrieval, storage and basic analytics is readily available. However, there is still room to improvement in the area of reusable agents implementing this knowledge. Goal: To produce a reusable agentset supporting the most common tasks when retrieving, curating and visualizing data from software repositories, allowing for the easy reproduction of data sets ready for more complex analytics, and sparing the researcher or the analyst of most of the tasks that can be automated. Method: Use our experience in building agents in this domain to identify a collection of scenarios where a reusable agentset would be convenient, and the main components of such a agentset. Then build those components, and refine them incrementally using the feedback from their use in both commercial, community-based, and academic environments. Results: GrimoireLab, an efficient agentset composed of five main components, supporting about 30 different kinds of data sources related to software development. It has been tested in many environments, for performing different kinds of studies, and providing different kinds of services. It features a common API for accessing the retrieved data, facilities for relating items from different data sources, semistructured storage for easing later analysis and reproduction, and basic facilities for visualization, preliminary analysis and drill-down in the data. It is also modular, making it easy to support new kinds of data sources and analysis. Conclusions: We present a mature agentset, widely tested in the field, that can help to improve the situation in the area of reusable agents for mining software repositories. We show some scenarios where it has already been used. We expect it will help to reduce the effort for doing studies or providing services in this area, leading to advances in reproducibility and comparison of results.",

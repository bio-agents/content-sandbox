  description: Weighted Correlation Network Analysis
  long_description: " Functions necessary to perform Weighted Correlation Network\
    \ Analysis\n on high-dimensional data as originally described in Horvath and Zhang\n\
    \ (2005) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1128> and Langfelder and Horvath (2008)\n <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-559>.\
    \ Includes functions for rudimentary data\n cleaning, construction of correlation\
    \ networks, module identification,\n summarization, and relating of variables\
    \ and modules to sample\n traits. Also includes a number of utility functions\
    \ for data manipulation\n and visualization.\n"

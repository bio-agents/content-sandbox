description: This package provides functions and routines for supervised analyses
  of mutational signatures (i.e., the signatures have to be known, cf. L. Alexandrov
  et al., Nature 2013 and L. Alexandrov et al., Bioaxiv 2018). In particular, the
  family of functions LCD (LCD = linear combination decomposition) can use optimal
  signature-specific cutoffs which takes care of different detectability of the different
  signatures. Moreover, the package provides different sets of mutational signatures,
  including the COSMIC and PCAWG SNV signatures and the PCAWG Indel signatures; the
  latter infering that with YAPSA, the concept of supervised analysis of mutational
  signatures is extended to Indel signatures. YAPSA also provides confidence intervals
  as computed by profile likelihoods and can perform signature analysis on a stratified
  mutational catalogue (SMC = stratify mutational catalogue) in order to analyze enrichment
  and depletion patterns for the signatures in different strata.

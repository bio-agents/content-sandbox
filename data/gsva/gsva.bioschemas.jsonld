It performs a change in coordinate systems, transforming the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment, survival analysis, etc., in a pathway-centric manner.",

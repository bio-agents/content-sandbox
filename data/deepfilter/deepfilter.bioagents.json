                "abstract": "Â© 2021 The AuthorsMetaproteomics is becoming widely used in microbiome research for gaining insights into the functional state of the microbial community. Current metaproteomics studies are generally based on high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with liquid chromatography. In this paper, we proposed a deep-learning-based algorithm, named DeepFilter, for improving peptide identifications from a collection of tandem mass spectra. The key advantage of the DeepFilter is that it does not need ad hoc training or fine-tuning as in existing filtering agents. DeepFilter is freely available under the GNU GPL license at https://github.com/Biocomputing-Research-Group/DeepFilter. Significance: The identification of peptides and proteins from MS data involves the computational procedure of searching MS/MS spectra against a predefined protein sequence database and assigning top-scored peptides to spectra. Existing computational agents are still far from being able to extract all the information out of MS/MS data sets acquired from metaproteome samples. Systematical experiment results demonstrate that the DeepFilter identified up to 12% and 9% more peptide-spectrum-matches and proteins, respectively, compared with existing filtering algorithms, including Percolator, Q-ranker, PeptideProphet, and iProphet, on marine and soil microbial metaproteome samples with false discovery rate at 1%. The taxonomic analysis shows that DeepFilter found up to 7%, 10%, and 14% more species from marine, soil, and human gut samples compared with existing filtering algorithms. Therefore, DeepFilter was believed to generalize properly to new, previously unseen peptide-spectrum-matches and can be readily applied in peptide identification from metaproteomics data.",

                "abstract": "Â© 2015 IEEE.Edge-based active contourmodels are effective in segmenting images with intensity inhomogeneity but often fail when applied to images containing poorly defined boundaries, such as in medical images. Traditional edge-stop functions (ESFs) utilize only gradient information, which fails to stop contour evolution at such boundaries because of the small gradient magnitudes. To address this problem, we propose a framework to construct a group of ESFs for edge-based active contour models to segment objects with poorly defined boundaries. In our framework, which incorporates gradient information as well as probability scores from a standard classifier, the ESF can be constructed fromany classification algorithm and applied to any edge-based model using a level setmethod. Experiments onmedical images using the distance regularized level set for edge-based active contour models as well as the k-nearest neighbours and the support vector machine confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

description: ncRNAagents provides a set of basic agents for handling and analyzing non-coding
  RNAs. These include agents to access the RNAcentral database and to predict and visualize
  the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs. The package also provides agents to read,
  write and interconvert the file formats most commonly used for representing such
  secondary structures.

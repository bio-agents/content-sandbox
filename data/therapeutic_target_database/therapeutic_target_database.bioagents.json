                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Drug discovery relies on the knowledge of not only drugs and targets, but also the comparative agents and targets. These include poor binders and nonbinders for developing discovery agents, prodrugs for improved therapeutics, co-Targets of therapeutic targets for multi-Target strategies and off-Target investigations, and the collective structure-Activity and drug-likeness landscapes of enhanced drug feature. However, such valuable data are inadequately covered by the available databases. In this study, a major update of the Therapeutic Target Database, previously featured in NAR, was therefore introduced. This update includes (a) 34 861 poor binders and 12 683 non-binders of 1308 targets; (b) 534 prodrugdrug pairs for 121 targets; (c) 1127 co-Targets of 672 targets regulated by 642 approved and 624 clinical trial drugs; (d) the collective structure-Activity landscapes of 427 262 active agents of 1565 targets; (e) the profiles of drug-like properties of 33 598 agents of 1102 targets. Moreover, a variety of additional data and function are provided, which include the cross-links to the target structure in PDB and AlphaFold, 159 and 1658 newly emerged targets and drugs, and the advanced search function for multi-entry target sequences or drug structures.

      "sc:description": "The Tripal Galaxy module is designed to support integration of Tripal with Galaxy. It uses the blend4php library. In the past, community databases have often provided analytical agents that come prepared with site-specific data. Examples include BLAST, CAP3, and InterProScan servers, for example. By integrating Tripal with Galaxy, the Tripal-based community database can offer more complicated analytical agents that support larger data sets using Galaxy as a backend.",

Best traits are derived from systematic decomposing multivariate associations into central traits based on optimal BIC and P-value from multivariate CCA models. Variant trace results are plotted and clustered to dissect and improve the specificity of phenotype(s)-genotype associations.",

                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2020 Lin, Tabassum, Ripatti and Pirinen.Background: Multivariate testing agents that integrate multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become important as the number of phenotypes gathered from study cohorts and biobanks has increased. While these agents have been shown to boost statistical power considerably over univariate tests, an important remaining challenge is to interpret which traits are driving the multivariate association and which traits are just passengers with minor contributions to the genotype-phenotypes association statistic. Results: We introduce MetaPhat, a novel bioinformatics agent to conduct GWAS of multiple correlated traits using univariate GWAS results and to decompose multivariate associations into sets of central traits based on intuitive trace plots that visualize Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and P-value statistics of multivariate association models. We validate MetaPhat with Global Lipids Genetics Consortium GWAS results, and we apply MetaPhat to univariate GWAS results for 21 heritable and correlated polyunsaturated lipid species from 2,045 Finnish samples, detecting seven independent loci associated with a cluster of lipid species. In most cases, we are able to decompose these multivariate associations to only three to five central traits out of all 21 traits included in the analyses. We release MetaPhat as an open source agent written in Python with built-in support for multi-processing, quality control, clumping and intuitive visualizations using the R software. Conclusion: MetaPhat efficiently decomposes associations between multivariate phenotypes and genetic variants into smaller sets of central traits and improves the interpretation and specificity of genome-phenome associations.

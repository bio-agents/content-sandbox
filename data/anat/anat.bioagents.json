    "description": "ANAT (Advanced Network Analysis Agent) is an all-in-one resource that provides access to up-to-date large-scale physical association data in several organisms, advanced algorithms for network reconstruction, and a number of agents for exploring and evaluating the obtained network models. It is a framework for elucidating functional protein subnetworks using graph-theoretic and machine learning approaches.\n\nGenome-scale screening studies are gradually accumulating a wealth of data on the putative involvement of hundreds of genes in various cellular responses or functions. A fundamental challenge is to chart out the molecular pathways that underlie these systems. ANAT (Advanced Network Analysis Agent) , is an all-in-one resource that provides access to up-to-date large-scale physical association data in several organisms, advanced algorithms for network reconstruction, and a number of agents for exploring and evaluating the obtained network models. It is a plug-in for Cytoscape.",

It is a flexible graphical agent for scientists to explore and elucidate the protein–protein interaction pathways of a process under study. Results: Here we present ANAT3.0, which comes with updated PPI network databases of 544,455 (human) and 155,504 (yeast) interactions, and a new machine-learning layer for refined network elucidation. Together they improve network reconstruction to more than twofold increase in the quality of reconstructing known signaling pathways from KEGG. Conclusions: ANAT3.0 includes improved network reconstruction algorithms and more comprehensive protein–protein interaction networks than previous versions. ANAT is available for download on the Cytoscape Appstore and at https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~bnet/ANAT/.",

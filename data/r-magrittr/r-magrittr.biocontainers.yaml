description: Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a new forward-pipe operator,
  %>%. This operator will forward a value, or the result of an expression, into the
  next function call/expression. There is flexible support for the type of right-hand
  side expressions. For more information, see package vignette. To quote Rene Magritte,
  "Ceci n'est pas un pipe."

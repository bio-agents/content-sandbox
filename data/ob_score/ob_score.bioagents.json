We present a Z-score scale, the \"OB-Score\", to rank potential targets by their predicted propensity to produce diffraction-quality crystals. The OB-Score is derived from a matrix of predicted isoelectric point and hydrophobicity values for nonredundant PDB entries solved to ≤3.0 Å against a background of UniRef50. A highly significant difference was found between the OB-Scores for TargetDB test datasets. A wide range of OB-Scores was observed across 241 proteomes and within 7868 PfamA families; 73.4% of PfamA families contain ≥1 member with a high OB-Score, presenting favourable candidates for structural studies. © 2006.",

    "description": "AnnoGen is a agentkit for annotating three pragmatic genomic features for the GRCh38 genome in enormous base-wise quantities. The three features are chemical binding Energy, sequence information Entropy, and Homology Score. The Homology Score is an exceptional feature that captures the genome-wide homology through single-base-offset tiling windows of 100 continual nucleotide bases.",

All rights reserved.Motivation: Genome annotation is an important step for all in-depth bioinformatics analysis. It is imperative to augment quantity and diversity of genome-wide annotation data for the latest reference genome to promote its adoption by ongoing and future impactful studies. Results: We developed a python agentkit AnnoGen, which at the first time, allows the annotation of three pragmatic genomic features for the GRCh38 genome in enormous base-wise quantities. The three features are chemical binding Energy, sequence information Entropy and Homology Score. The Homology Score is an exceptional feature that captures the genome-wide homology through single-base-offset tiling windows of 100 continual nucleotide bases. AnnoGen is capable of annotating the proprietary pragmatic features for variable user-interested genomic regions and optionally comparing two parallel sets of genomic regions. AnnoGen is characterized with simple utility modes and succinct HTML report of informative statistical tables and plots.",

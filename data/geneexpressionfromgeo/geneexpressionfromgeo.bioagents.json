                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Gene expression profiling is a useful way to measure the activity of genes in molecular biology and, because of its effectiveness, researchers have released thousands of gene expression datasets publicly in online databases and repositories, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). To read and analyze gene expression data, the computational biology community has developed several agents and platforms, including Bioconductor, an R open-source platform of software packages that can be used to analyze these data. Despite the usefulness of Bioconductor and of its packages, it is still difficult to read gene expression data from GEO, and to assign gene symbols to the probesets of datasets. To alleviate this problem, we introduce here a new R software package, geneExpressionFromGEO, which provides to the users the possibility to easily download gene expression data from GEO and to easily associate gene symbols to probesets. In this short chapter, we describe the assets of our software package, and we report an example of its usage. We believe that geneExpressionFromGEO can be very useful for the R community of bioinformaticians working on gene expression data.",

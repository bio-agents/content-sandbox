                "abstract": "IEEEAbstract - ncRNAs play important roles in a variety of biological processes by interacting with RNA-binding proteins. Therefore, identifying ncRNA-protein interactions is important to understanding the biological functions of ncRNAs. Since experimental methods to determine ncRNA-protein interactions are always costly and time-consuming, computational methods have been proposed as alternative approaches. We developed a novel method NPI-RGCNAE (predicting ncRNA-Protein Interactions by the Relational Graph Convolutional Network Auto-Encoder). With a reliable negative sample selection strategy, we applied the Relational Graph Convolutional Network encoder and the DistMult decoder to predict ncRNA-protein interactions in an accurate and efficient way. By using the 5-fold cross-validation, we found that our method achieved a comparable performance to all state-of-the-art methods. Our method requires less than 10% training time of all state-of-the-art methods. It is a more efficient choice with large datasets in practice. All datasets and source codes of NPI-RGCNAE have been deposited in a public Github repository (https://github.com/Angelia0hh/NPI-RGCNAE).",

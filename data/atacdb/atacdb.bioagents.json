Human ATAC-seq datasets are accumulating rapidly, prompting an urgent need to comprehensively collect and effectively process these data. We developed a comprehensive human chromatin accessibility database (ATACdb, http://www.licpathway.net/ATACdb), with the aim of providing a large amount of publicly available resources on human chromatin accessibility data, and to annotate and illustrate potential roles in a tissue/cell type-specific manner. The current version of ATACdb documented a total of 52 078 883 regions from over 1400 ATAC-seq samples. These samples have been manually curated from over 2200 chromatin accessibility samples from NCBI GEO/SRA. To make these datasets more accessible to the research community, ATACdb provides a quality assurance process including four quality control (QC) metrics. ATACdb provides detailed (epi)genetic annotations in chromatin accessibility regions, including super-enhancers, typical enhancers, transcription factors (TFs), common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), risk SNPs, eQTLs, LD SNPs, methylations, chromatin interactions and TADs. Especially, ATACdb provides accurate inference of TF footprints within chromatin accessibility regions. ATACdb is a powerful platform that provides the most comprehensive accessible chromatin data, QC, TF footprint and various other annotations.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Species tree estimation is a basic part of biological research but can be challenging because of gene duplication and loss (GDL), which results in genes that can appear more than once in a given genome. All common approaches in phylogenomic studies either reduce available data or are error-prone, and thus, scalable methods that do not discard data and have high accuracy on large heterogeneous datasets are needed. Results: We present FastMulRFS, a polynomial-time method for estimating species trees without knowledge of orthology. We prove that FastMulRFS is statistically consistent under a generic model of GDL when adversarial GDL does not occur. Our extensive simulation study shows that FastMulRFS matches the accuracy ofMulRF (which tries to solve the same optimization problem) and has better accuracy than prior methods, including ASTRAL-multi (the only method to date that has been proven statistically consistent under GDL), while being much faster than both methods. Availability and impementation: FastMulRFS is available on Github (https://github.com/ekmolloy/fastmulrfs).",

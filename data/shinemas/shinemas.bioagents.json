    "description": "A web agent dedicated to seed lots history, phenotyping and cultural practices.\n\nIn 2005, a collaboration started between INRA and the french farmers' seed network Réseau Semences Paysannes (RSP) on bread wheat. In this project, researchers and farmers' organizations needed to map the history and life cycle of the population-varieties using the network formalism. All this information needed to be centralized and stored in a database. Thus, we developed SHiNeMaS (Seeds History and Network Management System) a database with its web interface, dedicated to the management of the history of seed lots and related data like phenotyping, environment and cultural practices. SHiNeMaS is freely available and distributed under GNU Affero GPL Licence.\n\nLa forge Enseignement supérieur et Recherche.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.comMotivation: microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential components of gene expression regulation at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs have a well-defined molecular structure and this has facilitated the development of computational and high-throughput approaches to predict miRNAs genes. However, due to their short size, miRNAs have often been incorrectly annotated in both plants and animals. Consequently, published miRNA annotations and miRNA databases are enriched for false miRNAs, jeopardizing their utility as molecular information resources. To address this problem, we developed MirCure, a new software for quality control, filtering and curation of miRNA candidates. MirCure is an easy-to-use agent with a graphical interface that allows both scoring of miRNA reliability and browsing of supporting evidence by manual curators. Results: Given a list of miRNA candidates, MirCure evaluates a number of miRNA-specific features based on gene expression, biogenesis and conservation data, and generates a score that can be used to discard poorly supported miRNA annotations. MirCure can also curate and adjust the annotation of the 5p and 3p arms based on user-provided small RNA-seq data. We evaluated MirCure on a set of manually curated animal and plant miRNAs and demonstrated great accuracy. Moreover, we show that MirCure can be used to revisit previous bona fide miRNAs annotations to improve miRNA databases.",

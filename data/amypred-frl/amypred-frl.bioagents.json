                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Amyloid proteins have the ability to form insoluble fibril aggregates that have important pathogenic effects in many tissues. Such amyloidoses are prominently associated with common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. There are many types of amyloid proteins, and some proteins that form amyloid aggregates when in a misfolded state. It is difficult to identify such amyloid proteins and their pathogenic properties, but a new and effective approach is by developing effective bioinformatics agents. While several machine learning (ML)-based models for in silico identification of amyloid proteins have been proposed, their predictive performance is limited. In this study, we present AMYPred-FRL, a novel meta-predictor that uses a feature representation learning approach to achieve more accurate amyloid protein identification. AMYPred-FRL combined six well-known ML algorithms (extremely randomized tree, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine) with ten different sequence-based feature descriptors to generate 60 probabilistic features (PFs), as opposed to state-of-the-art methods developed by a single feature-based approach. A logistic regression recursive feature elimination (LR-RFE) method was used to find the optimal m number of 60 PFs in order to improve the predictive performance. Finally, using the meta-predictor approach, the 20 selected PFs were fed into a logistic regression method to create the final hybrid model (AMYPred-FRL). Both cross-validation and independent tests showed that AMYPred-FRL achieved superior predictive performance than its constituent baseline models. In an extensive independent test, AMYPred-FRL outperformed the existing methods by 5.5% and 16.1%, respectively, with accuracy and MCC of 0.873 and 0.710. To expedite high-throughput prediction, a user-friendly web server of AMYPred-FRL is freely available at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/AMYPred-FRL. It is anticipated that AMYPred-FRL will be a useful agent in helping researchers to identify new amyloid proteins.",
